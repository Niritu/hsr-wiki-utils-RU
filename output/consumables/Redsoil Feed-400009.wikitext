|description = High-purity redsoil is a rather unusual material: During the drying process, the crystallizing insoluble salts cause the entire block of redsoil to harden into a compact whole that is difficult to erode, even by wind and rain. Interestingly, for dromases, the most delicious redsoil lies right at the threshold between wet and dry.
