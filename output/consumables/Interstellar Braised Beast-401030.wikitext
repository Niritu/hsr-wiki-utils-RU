|description = The fitness meal developed by Juhuan, the "Brawn Author." It is made from intensely boiling meat from different interstellar beasts. It is extremely nutritious but extremely foul in taste &mdash; However, given how Juhuan craves to become a god, the pain he must endure while eating is a part of his trials too.<br />By the way, he's already writing the mantra that he will distribute to his disciples once he ascends to godhood. It's temporarily named ''The Compendium of Juhuan's Brawn Doctrines''.
