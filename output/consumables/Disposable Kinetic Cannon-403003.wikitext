|description = In a graveyard full of scraped machines, Rubert I the future emperor awoke. It had nothing more than a damaged logic unit, an old engine, a RAM with 90 GB left, and a robotic arm that had 1 movable finger. A loud blast was heard 30 system hours later &mdash; Rubert had busted open the iron gate at the top of the graveyard with a disposable kinetic cannon. The shock wave of the explosion damaged its logic unit even more, but Rubert knew that it now held destiny by its throat.
