|description = A signature delicacy from the "Astral Express" prepared by Conductor Pom-Pom themselves. First, the poultry (any species, preferably avian) is marinated and coated with Pom-Pom's special seasoning and breading. Then, with the heating and pressure of controlled high-energy particles, it is deep-fried precisely for a duration of 0.2434 seconds until golden brown. The result is a dish blessed with a tender exterior and a juicy interior. One bite and you'll feel as if you're being caressed by the gentle gaze of Akivili, soothed in comfort and warmth.
