|description = A fermented food item created by an outworld civilization. A delicious pot of soup can be created by just placing a tiny chunk of this in boiling water. Additionally, it can also be used to stirfry, prepare a hotpot, or additional flavoring for meat. The poetic piece "Litany of Miso Hotpot" described it thusly:

{{Description|''"Green are the waters on which fragrant celeries glide, and yellow the daylilies that cast their deliciousness astride. As the boiling flow tumbles like fabrics bundled in a bind, the warmth of the taste does hollow stomachs a favor most kind."''}}
'''Izumo Miso''' is a consumable that the player can use.
