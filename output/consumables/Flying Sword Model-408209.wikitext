|description = This travel souvenir sold aboard the Skysplitter, based on Yanqing's flying sword, is quite popular among tourists. Despite being a toy sword, its quality is immaculate, even serving as a suitable training prop for beginners. Yanqing once intentionally used it to beat several challengers who lacked martial virtue to the point of crying for their parents.
