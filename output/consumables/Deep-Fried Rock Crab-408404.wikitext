|description = Fried Rock Crab with a crispy crust and tender inside. This kind of crab wreaked havoc in Belobog before the Eternal Freeze occurred, and then inexplicably almost became extinct.<br />The meat of it is soft, tender, and delicious. Could this be the reason for their extinction? You dare not think further.
