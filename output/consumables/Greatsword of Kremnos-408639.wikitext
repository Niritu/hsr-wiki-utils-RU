|description = A large weapon of exaggerated size, capable of shattering armor with a single strike. It is not made of fine iron, but rather from sharp rune stones and imbued with the power of Strife. Only Mountain Dweller soldiers and Titankins can wield it. As for humans... with enough training, they may have a chance.
