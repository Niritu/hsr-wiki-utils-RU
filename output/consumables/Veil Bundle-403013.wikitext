|description = Caravans in Amphoreus often sell these mysterious, loosely twine-wrapped bundles. They could be unwanted trash or gifts from the Titans to mortals, with unpredictable surprises upon opening. It's said that this is a tradition among Oronyx's followers, who view such enigmatic goods as a ritual of offering pros and cons to fate, leaving the power of determining value to the Evernight Veil's capriciousness.
