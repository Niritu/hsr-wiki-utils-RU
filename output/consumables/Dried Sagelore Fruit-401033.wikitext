|description = Grove Scholars can weave knowledge into the sacred tree, and with Cerces' permission, they may harvest its fruit that houses condensed wisdom. Each of these Titan-blessed seeds holds information weightier than a library. But even so, like any other information vessel, the seeds have a limited shelf life as carriers of knowledge. Fortunately, their shelf life as food far outlasts that as a knowledge vessel &mdash; thus, this delicious dried fruit was born.
