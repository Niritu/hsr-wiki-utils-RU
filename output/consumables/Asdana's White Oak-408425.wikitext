|description = A beverage that (Trailblazer) sells on (The Radiant Feldspar/The Trailblaze's Stern/The Tatalov/The Soaring Clock Hand). In reality, it is an expensive drink of single malt juice, but you can imbibe it as much as you want in the Dreamscape.<br />Under Boothill's recommendation, a bullet will be left soaked in the drink when sold. He said this would add a special flavor, but maybe only his augmented tongue could taste it.
