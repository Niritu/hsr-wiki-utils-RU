|description = Steelclaw Beasts, also known as Bladed Black Velvets, were a type of dangerous creatures once found in the ancient lands of Castrum Kremnos. The beast had exaggerated sword-like claws capable of slicing through finely crafted weapons in a single swipe. Although now extinct, warriors have crafted weapons mimicking the anatomy of their claws, with unique blades that cause wounds to bleed continuously.
