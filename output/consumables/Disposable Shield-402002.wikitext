|description = When the Armed Archaeologists of Intelligentsia Guild was first established, its casualty rate reached an appalling 34.88%, for they were met with heavy resistance from the natives wherever they went because of their barbaric behavior. To change this, the Interastral Peace Corporation provided them with large quantities of basic protection gears that can fend off one fatal blow when hit.<br />While the protection offered by these gears was limited, they did reduce the casualty rate by 9.72%, at least on paper. The IPC was very pleased to see that.
