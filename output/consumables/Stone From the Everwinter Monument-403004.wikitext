|description = The Mourning Actors came to Jarilo-VI a long time ago. They were not aware of the Architects. The only sight they witnessed was the trail of destruction left by the Legion. They rowed their gondolas quietly above the planet and left before the Legion could notice them, leaving behind a silent eulogy.<br />Time flew by, and the Belobog Architects found a type of beautiful stone that glimmered with bright colors. They mixed the stone with Geomarrow and built a monument, which some say still stands at the heart of Qlipoth Fort in the city of Belobog.
