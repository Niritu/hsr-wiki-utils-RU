|description = At the end of the Mappou Age of the Dharma, the Dazzling Ninja Hero rescued the dreamlands from the siege of fiends, but was harassed by Fiendling Rumbletums, causing her powers to wane and making it difficult to fully exorcise the demons. Fortunately, Ninja Initiate Patissier came to her aid, infusing Dazzling Ninjutsu into sugar pills to satisfy the Ninja Hero's hunger, allowing her to restore peace to the dreamlands.
