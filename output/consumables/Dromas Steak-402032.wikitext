|description = A classic Okheman delicacy &mdash; grilled dromas steak, best served on redsoil for the most authentic flavor. Much like cattle in many worlds, dromases used for meat are technically a different breed from those used for labor. This variety of dromas has tender and flavorful meat, but if not prepared properly, it's about as enjoyable as eating redsoil.
