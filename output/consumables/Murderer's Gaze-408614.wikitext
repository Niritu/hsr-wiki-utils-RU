|description = You vividly recall that fateful night: cowering in the cupboard, too terrified to make a sound. As the man who brutally murdered your parents turned his gaze toward you, the look in his eyes was etched into your memory.<br />Now, as you stand over his lifeless body, the jubilation of vengeance courses through your veins. Yet, as you wash up, a sense of terror engulfs you as you catch a glimpse of your own eyes in the mirror.
