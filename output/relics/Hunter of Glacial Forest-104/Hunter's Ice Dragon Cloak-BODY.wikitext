{{Description|A cloak made from the fine scales of the Ice Dragon, nearly invisible under the brilliant refraction of light.}}
'''Hunter's Ice Dragon Cloak''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Hunter of Glacial Forest]].

==Description==
The Lord of the Ice Lake, whose body was fully covered in unique scales that dazzlingly reflected the sunlight, could easily render itself invisible by diving underwater. Few hunters could handle a battle with such an invisible monstrosity.

Days later, the registered hunters of the association stumbled upon the Ice Dragon's carcass with its scales already peeled off. At that moment, their horror surpassed their shock.

The beasts that Hugh had hunted down numbered in the thousands, each and every one of which was uniquely precious. Only by reaching a thorough understanding of the prey's traits and habits would a hunter truly achieve the full completion of a hunt... For Hugh, the Lord of the Ice Lake was the last piece in the puzzle that was the Snow Plains. Hence, he must finish the hunt, to bring his Hunter's Soul to completion.

And now, the highest prized bounty was put on the head of Hugh the Hunter, instead of the Lord of the Ice Lake, marking the beginning of a hideous all-out hunt.

All hunters should be prepared to become the prey. It was so for Hugh, and even more so for those traitors.
