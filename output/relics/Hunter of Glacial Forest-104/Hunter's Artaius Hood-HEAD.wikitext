'''Hunter's Artaius Hood''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Hunter of Glacial Forest]].

==Description==
The hunters' rule for surviving the Snow Plains of Snowland was simple enough &mdash; Never go to the south of the mountain during Artaius' hunting season, since that mountain-shaking white bear did not welcome anyone.

As the hunter sent by the association, Hugh went to the south of the mountain after receiving the rescue call. Never did he expect to walk right into an ambush long in the planning.

After waking up from a long shock induced by gunshots, Hugh immediately realized he just barely escaped death. However, he also realized his plight was far from over, for Artaius was staring right at him. Despite the short range and fast pace, some of Artaius' messy attacks were bound to miss... Hugh calmly waited for an opening, then he whipped out his bone blade soaked in poison and jumped up for an extraordinary strike in the blink of an eye. Their positions as the predator and the prey were reverted.

After removing Artaius' head and fur, he managed to survive the first night in snow despite his untreated gunshot wounds.

Days later, the Hunters Association located Artaius' the headless corpse. It was then they realized the hunter who was supposed to die had survived, and an unforeseen avenger was born.
