{{Description|A pair of enhanced power boots wrapped in soft elk fur. With these, the hunter will only leave shallow footprints behind in the Snow Plains.}}
'''Hunter's Soft Elkskin Boots''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Hunter of Glacial Forest]].

==Description==
Despite being deeply wounded and too weak to maintain a body temperature that can melt snow, a dying torch-antler elk was still a most dangerous beast.

Hugh pointed his hunting rifle straight at the dying elk. Looking at those awe-inducing eyes, he thought those reminded him of his own.

Ever since the ambush by the registered hunters, Hugh's life force had already become depleted like a dying candle in the wind. He was sharply aware that the only reason he managed to survive was due to his unyielding desire for revenge. Should it become satiated, his life would instantly come to an end, scattered like snowflakes... Despite his heavy footsteps, Hugh's large soft elk-skin boots did not leave any prints on the ground. He must stay sharp for the last hunt of his life.

Amid panic and hysteria, the Hunters Association began to crumble. They began to purge traitors in haste, hoping it could grant them Hugh's mercy. Instead, it only led to their own self-destruction by mutual distrust.

Hugh fell down for good on the Snowy Plains before he could get a taste of the pleasure of completing his revenge.
