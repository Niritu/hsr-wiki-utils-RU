{{Description|A pair of tactical gloves, on which scaly claws of snowrock lizards are tightly sewn. It can be used to safely climb up and hang on to any wall.}}
'''Hunter's Lizard Gloves''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Hunter of Glacial Forest]].

==Description==
Snowrock lizards lack agility and strength, but they can wait in ambush on a rock for two weeks for the precise moment when their prey lets down its guard, then finally striking a fatal blow.

Registered hunters, however, couldn't wait that long. They decided to march into the snowy mountains to hunt down Hugh and neutralize this approaching threat.

Though there were many exceptionally powerful talents among the registered hunters of the association, they were never comrades who had each other's back. Hunters congregated only for the hefty prize of the bounty, and would betray one another without hesitation for the right price. After all, anything could happen on these desolate plains... As long as the old hunter Hugh was taken care of, everyone would earn more bounty. That was their consensus, for which they paid the price.

Hugh made more than enough preparations. Hunting the top hunters would be no easier a task than hunting monsters. Hugh must be more patient than ever, for patience was always the most valued trait in a hunter.

Before long, the number of registered hunters in the Hunters Association began to dwindle, for the horror known as Hugh the Undead was spreading.
