{{Description|A trendy courier satchel. It's adorned with many cute accessories.}}
'''Messenger's Secret Satchel''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Messenger Traversing Hackerspace]].

==Description==
Financial magnates in the Capital of Passion monitor all information flow in the city. They are used to maintaining their dominance using information monopoly, and all who try to subvert this control will be punished by the Public Security Regulation.

People once protested, which only made the financial magnates dish out some convenient compromises. Soon enough, people gave up on the idea of "privacy."

The financial magnates greedily collect every piece of information whether it is important or trivial, or whether it arose from reality or virtual realms. As a result, the messengers' courier satchels have become the final bastion of privacy. The satchel is small, lightweight, and can only carry chips or documents. Despite these shortcomings, the final remains of "informational independence" in the Capital of Passion was solely ensured by these tiny blind spots.

"Why do people still transmit information outside of the internet in the prosperous Capital of Passion? The messengers also want to know the answer."

This limited edition Yellow Ducky courier satchel may be a bit old, but its various accessories make it still in fashion.
