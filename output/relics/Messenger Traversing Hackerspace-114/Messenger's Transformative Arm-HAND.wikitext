{{Description|A cybernetic prosthetic arm that can be disassembled at will. Capable of firing knuckles like bullets.}}
'''Messenger's Transformative Arm''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Messenger Traversing Hackerspace]].

==Description==
Not all messengers have cybernetic prosthetic arms, but those who do often have a strong passion to modify it. After all, no one wants to have a cybernetic limb that looks identical to everyone else's.

The residents of the Capital of Passion are obsessed with cybernetic prosthetics, while the city's limited regulations can only advise against the frenzy of excessive body modification.

The registered standards for modifications in the Capital of Passion only contains three categories, with a total of eighteen types. This is clearly not enough for the rebellious messengers. They invest huge amounts of their salaries into imaginative designs. They create blueprints that enable their electronic conversion machinery to release lightning or transform their prosthetic hands into missiles, and the designs become increasingly outrageous as fees to engage messengers skyrocket.

"Are these messengers running to protect information, or are they running to earn exorbitant fees?"

This Yellow Ducky prosthetic arm has undergone special modifications, with each finger joint able to rotate at high speeds and be launched like a bullet.
