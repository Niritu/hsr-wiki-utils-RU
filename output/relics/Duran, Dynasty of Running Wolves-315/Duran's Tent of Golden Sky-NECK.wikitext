{{Description|Encapsulated in the plane is the Golden Sky Tent belonging to the borisins of Verdantia. Different to the savage name that borisin left in the cosmos, the borisins of Verdantia possess outstanding biotechnology. The children of the wolves gather next to the great Brood Lord Duran, and regard the celestial objects in the sky as their herd as they gallop between the stars.}}
'''Duran's Tent of Golden Sky''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Duran, Dynasty of Running Wolves]].

==Description==
The beginning of ancient foxian and borisin ballads all nostalgically sing of the "Planet of Verdantia" and its fertile soil and pleasant climate. However, upon closer inspection, the perceptive ones will realize such words are mere preludes to the eternal theme of "war."

With their talents for agriculture and commerce, some fox clans built prosperous towns next to flowing rivers. Meanwhile, the children of wolves roamed with their herd under the aurora-covered sky within the lush grasslands, forming settlements that dotted the landscape. The merchants laughed at the herders for the latter's savagery, while the herders despised the merchants for their deception. However, they both must confront the cruel torments of nature &mdash; the "Vulpesummer" and "Lupuswinter."

In the summer of rich harvests blessed by the fox deity, the two clans put down their arms and ceased warfare in mutual satisfaction. But once the wolf deity lets fall the white frost, the snowlines would spread from the poles and hunger shall drive the two clans to unceasing conflict.

The ballads mention that the Lupuswinter once stayed far beyond its due, even after the sun of Verdantia had circled the planet thirty-three times. Poverty and hunger crashed the people, and they resorted to even eating animals they once worshipped as totems. After foreseeing the end where the entire world shall be covered in bleak death, a savior climbed to the peak of the tallest mountain in that world &mdash; The foxian legends called her "Tushan," but the borisin sagas called him "Duran." No matter what this savior was called, they made a wish to the Master of Immortality, hoping for sustenance enough to keep the world's people alive. Then, the mountains split, and sweet divine nectar of Redspring poured out from the hilly ravines.

Those who drank from the Redspring obtained power, dexterity, and strength from the beast meat they devoured. Their blood, too, stirred with the ferocity of animals, and their bodily forms became increasingly bestial &mdash; Thus was this world changed, never to return to its former days.

With the Redspring as the medium, everything that the reborn canine races needed was made from this miraculous source &mdash; The fields no longer grew grain but viscorpi instead, and the garments that covered people's bodies were no longer of linen but of embryonic flesh. Even the chilly snowlands that once terrified the Verdantia civilizations were no longer a concern, for the canine races cultivated biological membranes in the polar regions to craft into warm dome-shaped tents, blocking the impoverished Lupuswinter beyond this barrier.

Then, things changed in the Planet of Verdantia, just like how things changed for every short-life species that became long-life &mdash; There was population explosion, ecological collapse, internal warfare... And no matter how hard the canine races prayed to the Master of Immortality, they never heard another reply. Then, the people understood the truth: Everything that the Master of Immortality could give had been given, and if the people wished to have better lives, they must take more by themselves.

Gathered around Duran the great Brood Lord, the canine races cast their sight into the sky where the Master of Immortality dwelled. The stars sparkled like a grassland waiting to be conquered with fast steads, and they will bring the "Lupuswinter" to the civilizations on those planets.

Much later, their sworn enemies dubbed them "borisin," for it signified "wolf" in the vernacular of Verdantia.
