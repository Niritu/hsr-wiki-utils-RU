{{Description|These were the reins, shackles, and whips. The first thing taught to borisin youths who had grown taller than war beasts' legs was to always grasp the reins tight in their hands, or else the youths themselves would become enslaved livestock &mdash; or worse, become feed.}}
'''Duran's Mechabeast Bridle''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Duran, Dynasty of Running Wolves]].

==Description==
In the borisin language, the bridle was also called assa-chita, meaning "the living book."

When the dual rising moons meet, and the night sky is at its brightest, the voodoo masters of the hunting tribe gift bridles to the children of Duran to symbolize them entering adulthood. This blank bridle would become a book that records the history of their battles throughout their lives.

As soon as the adulthood ceremony ends, the borisin youths must walk into the weapon farm, then pick and tame their first battle mount among the "mechabeasts" that have been filtered and bred via gene witchcraft. Mechabeasts that consume the conquered as their feed have astounding agility, perception, and ferocity &mdash; Yet they are considered mere sheep when facing against their future masters. As the moonlight stirs the violent blood in their veins, the borisin youths chase and duel against the mechabeasts. Some will die from the beast's kiss &mdash; That is the result of cowardice. Some will kill their peers &mdash; That is the law of how valiant beasts shall be distributed... The borisin youths trip the desired mount to the ground and tie the bridle, which is inlaid with neural spike whips, onto the animal's neck &mdash; The beast will be stunned through telepathy with its future master and become as tame as if they already received hundreds of whiplashes. When the beast willingly carries the master on its back, a fitting borisin sorya (warrior, rider) will have been born.

Then, the borisin bridle will become the recorder of wars, and the reins will gradually become full of scratches, knots, and accessories.

The well-trained sorya dons jellyfish-like membranous armor under the leadership of a yonda (leader, centurion). They then board the beast ships that can warp between stars, explore different worlds, and swear in the name of Duran and the Master of Immortality to make the stars into their herding ground. On the bridle, light scratches indicate how many enemies the owner had slain, knots record how many major campaigns they were involved in, and the accessories dangling from the reins are loot such as human teeth and Intellitron cores obtained from pillaging frenzies... They are the vengeful wails of the conquered, as well as medals for borisin individuals to demonstrate their strength.

When the mounts beneath the warrior perish in warfare, or when borisin wish to mete out punishment, the bridle can also be fastened around the bodies of other living beings.

Their targets are usually foxians &mdash; The slave race excluded from the clan due to genetic selection plans. They are weak, devious, and are only fit for lowly labor and calculations. Whenever rare war-like individuals emerge among the foxians, the master of the wolf-head would prioritize binding these foxians with the bridles, driving them as war slaves to serve as vanguards on the battlefield.

If all slaves are dead, and the weapons are bent, then the bridle can still act as a whip if one attaches a spike to the end. If the bridle is snapped and the warrior perishes in war with their fangs and claws shattered, then the bridle will become the sole remaining epitaph and memories for borisin...

Just as the old tales said that "the position between the predator and prey often changes in the forest," countless wolf-kind bridles have been broken and snapped after fighting for millennia against the Xianzhou in this dark forest called the universe. In the end, this link that connects various clans is severed by the sharp arrow of The Hunt, and the borisin also fall into the shadow of internal strife and general decay, becoming ever more removed from their former pride.
