'''Grand Duke's Gloves of Fieryfur''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[The Ashblazing Grand Duke]].

==Description==
Ifrit orchestrated countless crises bent on annihilating lives. The Grand Duke fancied themselves as a conductor, and must wear gloves to hold the conductor's baton covered in thorns.

"I come with Destruction's revelation. One hand giveth, and the other taketh away."

Firmly believing that "the preciousness of something can only be appreciated in its eradication," Duke Inferno torched the history and culture of the planet Lisalit, scorching the brilliant silks of the aristocracy, incinerating the long scrolls of the poets, razing the vivid murals of the painters to ash... "Civilization is like a larva. It will only be reborn in a burning execution, when it turns into a black butterfly that flutters away in the wind." Like an undertaker who lowers their head to monitor the crematorium's furnace, Ifrit guides civilizations into their swansong.

"Through my efforts, imagination, and direction... the synchronization, number of performances, tone, and tempo of the different catastrophes... all fuse into a brilliant masterpiece of destructive performance."

After the end of a satisfying destruction, Ifrit wipes the blood off their hands and dons pristine white gloves again, as if they were an aristocrat attending a banquet.
