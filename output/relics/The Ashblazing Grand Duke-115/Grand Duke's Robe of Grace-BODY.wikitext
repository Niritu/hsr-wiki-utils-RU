{{Description|A gorgeous robe that emphasizes the dignity and elegance of its owner.}}
'''Grand Duke's Robe of Grace''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[The Ashblazing Grand Duke]].

==Description==
The elegant fire demon admires their image in the dressing mirror after an inhumane massacre. An audience with a monarch always requires appropriate finery.

"The purpose of clothing is not to adorn one's appearance, but to display one's true essence &mdash; just as the essence of flame is to destroy."

The ever-burning clan of fire demons regards Nanook as their emperor and savior, but the Aeon had never glimpsed at them. Ifrit's destruction is laced with flaunts, power, conquest, and motivation, and the rivalry between the Ever-Flame Mansion and the Jepella Brotherhood was even more sordid. "Impure destruction stains the most magnificent garments more easily than dirt." Regarding purity, Ifrit has never been able to grasp its essence from the start.

"The value of destruction lies in the value of the thing destroyed. Our value lies in our practice of Destruction until our emperor takes notice."

Ifrit, with piety in their heart, wears brocaded garments woven with velvet-red flames, and waits for the summon of the Destruction.
