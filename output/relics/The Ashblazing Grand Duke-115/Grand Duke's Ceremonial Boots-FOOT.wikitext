'''Grand Duke's Ceremonial Boots''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[The Ashblazing Grand Duke]].

==Description==
Wherever the elegant fire demon's trail wound, the smoldered civilizations silently wailed. Ifrit never paid them any attention &mdash;

"Those who have no roads left to walk on don't need boots. Why must these civilizations at their end whinge at me?"

Duke Inferno, with the crown of fire on their head, is considered by many civilizations as an otherworldly demon, yet receives an invitation from the planet of festivities. Ifrit is happy to attend in full ceremonial garb. "I will prepare a courteous and thoughtful destruction, and not a single bone will be left behind." The elegant fire demon assembles a party of cosmic evil, and plans the grandiose scene of offering a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood for the banquet... Those destroyed civilizations are but mere stops on the pilgrimage to Destruction, and Penacony will just be another pit stop along the way.

 "Your destruction is nothing personal. It is just for the purpose of earning THEIR gaze."

At the sound of the distant banquet calling, Ifrit cheerfully embarks on the long journey to the feast.
