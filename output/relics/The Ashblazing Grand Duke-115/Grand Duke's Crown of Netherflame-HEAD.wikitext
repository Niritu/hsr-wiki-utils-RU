{{Description|A crown of unceasing flame, with its burning ambition serving as its inexhaustible fuel.}}
'''Grand Duke's Crown of Netherflame''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[The Ashblazing Grand Duke]].

==Description==
The elegant fire demon was born in the most fiery of all fires, and believes Destruction to be the supreme glory bestowed upon Fetora.

"I, born on the eve of destruction, am the sinful belief of Fetora. I am the furious flames of Nanook."

Nanook destroyed Fetora by THEIR own hands, and the White Star's flames coalesced with the power of Destruction to birth a plasmic lifeforms. The elegant fire demon saw its birth as a revelation. "Today, the Lord of Destruction conquered Fetora. THEY honored it with blazing flames. The frivolous and meaningless glory evaporate with the solar flare, but concrete and heavy glory shall mark my coronation." Ifrit has been obsessed with destruction and slaughter since birth.

"The laurels of honor in this world are all woven of thorns. The only laurel that surpasses these thorns is my supreme crown of netherflame."

The embers left behind from the Aeon of Destruction's annihilation of a star were clasped in Ifrit's own hands, molded into the shape of Fetora's crown, and worn to this day.
