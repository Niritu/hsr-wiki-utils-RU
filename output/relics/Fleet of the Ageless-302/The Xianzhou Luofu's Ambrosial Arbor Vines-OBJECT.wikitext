{{Description|Once, the Luofu reigned supreme over other ships in the Xianzhou fleet due to the grace of the Ambrosial Arbor. Later, when people consumed the cursed fruit of immortality, calamity was brought upon the Luofu by the Ambrosial Arbor, whose vines had already entrapped the Luofu in its firm and inseparable grip.}}
'''The Xianzhou Luofu's Ambrosial Arbor Vines''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Fleet of the Ageless]].

==Description==
The master of Abundance buried the seed of karma in the center of the Xianzhou Luofu and gifted the Elixir Seekers with something named "Ambrosial Arbor," which was considered a miracle as people were able to immediately understand its implications.

The Ambrosial Arbor grew fruits of divinity that brimmed with life and vitality, containing the Endless Lifespan sought by the Elixir Seekers. From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history. People followed the way of immortality to exploit the Ambrosial Arbor with increasing intensity, making Fallow Earth that never exhausted itself, molding their own bodies to shapeshift, and giving the gift of thinking and talking to animals... Innumerable unimaginable technologies were brought into existence under the branches of the Ambrosial Arbor.

However, the Ambrosial Arbor took off its disguise as time went by, revealing its hideous visage as the agony of immortality crept upon the immortals.

The celestials ceaselessly reproduced, yet tasted no death. The ship groaned from overpopulation, as hunger and starvation tormented many. Xianzhou's young can never realize their life's ambitions while their elders clang to power, and society teetered at the edge of structural collapse... Rebellions of the aurumatons and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face. The so-called "Body of Celestials" was simply a technology that surpassed human intellect. The propensity to be stricken with mara was a warning to all Xianzhou natives, a reminder that they were a mere step away from becoming abominations themselves.

In desperation, a hero tore through the sky with a powerful shot from their bow, splitting the Ambrosial Arbor in half... Yet even if all there was left of the Ambrosial Arbor was a burnt stump, the fate of Xianzhou could never be separated from it.

It attracted external forces to invade Xianzhou. The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.

Fortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree. The people had vowed to cast this source of all distortions into the end of all things.
