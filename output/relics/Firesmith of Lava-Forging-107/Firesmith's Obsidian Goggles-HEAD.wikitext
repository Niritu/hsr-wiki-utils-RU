'''Firesmith's Obsidian Goggles''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Firesmith of Lava-Forging]].

==Description==
To the Firesmith clan, crafting unparalleled weapons is both their talent's calling and a lifelong curse.

Ever since the arrival of the liberated Firesmith Clan in the world of Warforge, their skills bloomed to the extremes while also becoming tainted with the aura of Destruction.

The dazzling light of the furnace, the sparks of metal clashing, and the long-lasting forging process can turn raw ore into a fine weapon, but can also gradually strip the firesmith of their eyesight. One day, at the bottom of a volcano, Foy found a deposit of rare obsidian flame crystal. From this, he carefully polished a pair of protective goggles, which transformed the fierce sparks of fire into pale-white silhouettes. However, the greedy smith was unable to fully escape his cursed fate either, burning everything he was into cinders in the ultimate fire.

Foy deemed the Antimatter Legion in the Warforge as the raw materials for his creations, and himself as the rising flame.

"I wonder... is it possible to harness the power of a thermonuclear reaction in my furnace?" Foy's pursuit of the ultimate fire came to an unfruitful end in an out-of-control thermonuclear fusion.
