{{Description|A ring with a symbol of flames. It is the highest symbol of honor among the Firesmith clan.}}
'''Firesmith's Ring of Flame-Mastery''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Firesmith of Lava-Forging]].

==Description==
A 900-degree kiln can turn clay into ceramic, a 1000-degree furnace can melt tin and copper... As one pursues a purer creation, one must also pursue a more extreme temperature.

Creatures of the Legion crave for separation from the material existence, longing for the fundamental mutations that can only be brought forth by the scorching heat waves of Destruction.

A highly-skilled master Firesmith can raise the forge's temperature to unbelievable levels &mdash; the flame's black-body radiation would exhibit the blue spectrum like that of a dying star. Firesmiths are also geniuses at controlling flames, but only the best among them are bestowed with a ring of flame-mastery as a mark of their superb skill.

The Warforge had long ceased to differentiate between the smith and the smithed. All those Firesmith masters who had been smelting the Antimatter Creatures had also become parts of the Weapons of Destruction.

"The smelting depends on the temperature, and the temperature depends on the Firesmith." This is matter-of-fact knowledge to any Firesmith who can control the art of Destruction.
