'''Firesmith's Alloy Leg''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Firesmith of Lava-Forging]].

==Description==
In the old days, the prison masters feared losing the extraordinary arts of Firesmithing, so they would employ the most despicable tricks to incarcerate the Firesmith clan &mdash; all the chiefs of the Firesmiths would undoubtedly suffer deformities in the legs in those days of imprisonment.

It was the Master of Destruction that set free the imprisoned Firesmith clan and bestowed upon them the mark of Destruction which in turn granted the Firesmiths unlimited power.

Despite the inability to move around like an able-bodied man, the chief of Firesmith obtained true freedom, for he was no longer imprisoned just for his extraordinary skills and talents in the art of Firesmithing. The chief poured in all his resentment and humiliation into the forge and would never be tired, not even by days of non-stop hammering. Upon one hammering after another, the once stubborn and proud antimatter creatures had to eventually change their form and give in to the remolding by the Destroyer.

Despite being free from any tangible cages, the Firesmiths' obsession with forging had become another form of prison for them, had it not?

"Flesh and blood are a burden. Forging is also destruction." The chief looked at the ever-growing number of deformed Firesmiths and lamented.
