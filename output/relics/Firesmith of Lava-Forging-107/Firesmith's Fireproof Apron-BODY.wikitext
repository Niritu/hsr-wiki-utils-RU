'''Firesmith's Fireproof Apron''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Firesmith of Lava-Forging]].

==Description==
The Antimatter Legion gifted the dying Warforge to the Firesmiths, letting them forge to their hearts' desire in a fiery world.

In this scorching world of lava, as long as the smelting and hammering never ceased, creation and destruction were no longer polar opposites of each other.

Surtur was especially good at using the molten magma that erupted from active volcanoes to infuse the Legion's creatures with a violent aura of destruction. Neither the bubbling of toxic gases nor the gurgling of magma could interrupt Surtur's concentration at the forge. Though burning waves of molten rock would splash on Surtur's fireproof apron of giant firelizard skin, the leather never lost its luster when the flames faded.

A massive proportion of the Legion's fighting forces were repeatedly hammered and smelted in the forge until their flesh and weaponry were fused together under the hammers of the Firesmiths, becoming weapons of Destruction.

"This incomparable power of destruction..." The Firesmiths who control the flames have never hidden the terrible aspirations they place in their weapons.
