==Description==
''"Who lives in a paradise deep in the woods?"''<br />''"Bananabud Longpants!"''<br />''"Long, yellow, energetic, and cute!"''<br />''"Bananabud Longpants!"''

"Thud. Thud." The noise reverberates twice and a half. Bananas wake from a deep slumber as they prepare to leave the banana tree and begin a new day in their banana lives! Some bananas wake invigorated, baking durians into pies, and frolic merrily in the woods. Some bananas are more solemn, rubbing coconuts on themselves to add some fragrance. The monkey looks upon this lively scene with satisfaction, unable to resist happily calling out to the bananas &mdash;

''"Are you ready, bananas?"''<br />''"Aye, Principal Monkey!"''<br />''"I can't hear you!"''<br />''"AYE! PRINCIPAL MONKEY!"''

"Thud. Thud. Thud." The sound reverberates three times and a half. It's time for the daily "Peel Club". The bananas begin to grow anxious. Some shout, some weep in silence, and some of them feel dead inside... The monkey asks the healthy bananas one by one. The topic on the large banana leaf never changes: "Do you remember a time beyond the banana?"

This simple question always results in bitter answers. The bananas do not know from where their sadness comes. It's just as natural as how the pulp of a banana turns black from oxidization when exposed to pressure from the outside world.

''"If exploring the world is your dream,"''<br />''"Then tap the banana tree, and let Principal Monkey show the way."''

"Thud. Thud. Thud..." The noise reverberates 7 times and a half. The "Motivanana Game" is about to begin. In this hidden forest paradise, every banana is promised that should they try hard enough, they will never remain a banana forever. Every banana holds a dream within them, striving to become a glorious monkey... As the forest recedes to two sides, Principal Monkey emerges from the middle, offering tender and modest gestures of bowing to the bananas. The bananas return the gesture &mdash; Principal Monkey has brought a brand-new game and wishes to "exchange" it for new stories.

"Thud. Thud. Thud..." The noise reverberated 11 times and a half. The bananas are carried by the monkey back up the tree. As they rock and sway, they return to utopia. The green sun flickers and the sound of gurgle rumbling echoes throughout paradise.
