{{Description|Optical cables that can be seen everywhere within the lab. They are used to collect experimental information to reach secretive goals that must not see the light of day. For the "Bananas," the way to perceive the world lurks within.}}
'''BananAmusement Park's Memetic Cables''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[The Wondrous BananAmusement Park]].

==Description==
The ruins of the Ba-77 research institute lay at Convergence-ψ, hidden underground beneath a jungle world. This place was once destroyed by extremist Rangers, and the remaining cables still flicker with unclear signals.

"That cursed research institute is as hard to find as a single leaf in a forest." Beneath layers of tree bark, the bones of plants form the shape of an entrance. After passing through a long tree hollow, the Rangers finally find their target.

This research institute is closer to an "art gallery" than a "laboratory." Cables run interwoven in the air above, leaking strange and colorful lights per the designer's intentions. The viewers all press their hands to their heads and feel a daze come over them. Then, grotesque illusions spread before their eyes &mdash; a pure-yellow liminal space, gradually row of fading human portraits, shapes of monsters hidden behind curtains...

The Rangers are familiar with these methods. If they linger in this installation, they will begin speaking nonsense and find their limbs compelled to flail... With a crisp sound from impact against the stock of a gun, the young Ranger uses pain and dizziness to emerge from the cognitive labyrinth.

Their vision now revitalized, the Rangers continue to proceed to the depths. The Ba-77 research institute is filled with collapsed statues, destroyed murals, super-saturated colorful decorations... And yet, the shattered containers littering the ground make this place seem like a prison instead. The Rangers discover a report in the lowest depths, then imagine the countless "cognitive experiments" that were conducted in this place before the building fell... In an instant, everyone turns around, compelled by their subconsciousness, and is surprised to find themselves in a woodland paradise. The leaves wave to them ceaselessly, inquiring whether they recall the wonder of being upon the trees.

"Aren't I a banana? By the way, what are we doing here?" The young Ranger tries to get back to the tree to stop himself from "banaxiety."

But the blind Ranger senses the problem. Before everything reaches the point of no return, he forcibly drags the youth away from that place.

"Banana... Those monkeys need to go banana themselves!"
