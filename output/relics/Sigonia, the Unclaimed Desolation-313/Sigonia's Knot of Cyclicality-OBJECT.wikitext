'''Sigonia's Knot of Cyclicality''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Sigonia, the Unclaimed Desolation]].

==Description==
"Avgin" means "honey" in the Sigonian language. It's a conventional term irretrievably lost in the long arc of cosmic history.

The Avgins are blessed with attractive facial features, beautiful eyes, and an innate wealth of emotional intelligence, all of which effortlessly endear themselves to any strangers. However, these inborn talents are the exact reason they draw jealousy and ire from others. And the envious and snobbish soon begin their ceaseless slander, and the baseless defamation of the Avgins thus spreads like wildfire throughout the cosmos. As mere rumors can suffice to tarnish the sanctity of truth, the Avgins, a people of a peripheral world, found themselves assailed without recourse, subject to all manners of suspicion and prejudice.

The Avgins have an appreciation for intricately patterned fabrics, as well as a penchant for jewelry crafted from precious gemstones. They're particularly fond of turquoise meteorites, the only kind of gemstones capable of rivaling the resplendence of Gaiathra Triclops' divine body, which in their mythology is believed to have been reborn from death.

Known as Fenge Biyos, their Mother Goddess reigns over all matters related to fertility, travels, and trickery. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only distance themselves from her protective embrace.

The Avgins view the world through the body of the Mother Goddess &mdash; the earth, the mountains, and all that exists on the land are a part of the Mother Goddess' divine body. And at the end of each calendar year, her divine body will perish.

On that significant day, her divine essence ascends as a resplendent aurora in the night sky and is reborn in the following day. Hence, Avgins celebrate the first day of the new year through their grand festival called "Kakava." During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as "Knots of Cyclicality" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth.

According to the incident report by the Marketing Development Department, that shocking conflict took place on a night of Kakava. It was a stormy night when the clouds and fog engulfed the northern lights, which should have been seen as an ill omen. However, the Avgin people were unexpectedly excited. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response.

"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess. She is calling to us, urging us to take up arms and fight for our future."<br />"This rain accompanies us. This rain protects us. It is in this rain that we shall meet our honorable demise."
