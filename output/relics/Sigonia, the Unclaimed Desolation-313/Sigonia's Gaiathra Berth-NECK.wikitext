'''Sigonia's Gaiathra Berth''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Sigonia, the Unclaimed Desolation]].

==Description==
When discussing Oswaldo Schneider, the head of the IPC's Marketing Development Department, people often focus on the decisive operations he undertook upon assuming the position. Within just two years, this young fanatic conquered the bitter cold, pestilence, and death, and managed to address three major longstanding issues that had plagued the Department for several Amber Eras. One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of harsh conditions and strife.

Situated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the "eye of the storm" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild.

In reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size.

They share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that "Katica" means "shellslasher," who have a reputation of being the most ferocious clan among Sigonians. And "Avgin" means "honey," who are often accused of pilfering by those willfully ignorant. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, engaged in a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive &mdash; until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. From there, Sigonians were briefly united under the radiance of Amber, and the natural cycles that were finally reached a temporary conclusion.

Afterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the wider Cosmos.

Unfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Some malicious opportunists among the Sigonians viewed the former's resourcefulness with suspicion, while slandering the latter as nothing more than predators with no hope of enlightenment. Although they possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, these devious and corrupt individuals banished both clans to the endless desert.

As a token of apology, they even went out of their way to declare that "the Avgins shall forever retain the right to autonomy" &mdash; In other words, should any future conflicts occur between the two clans, they could justifiably and lawfully sit back and do nothing.
