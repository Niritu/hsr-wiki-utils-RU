{{Description|Before the Temple of Dusk in spring, the most outstanding of bards will receive a dill wreath bequeathed by Mnestia.}}
'''Poet's Dill Wreath''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Poet of Mourning Collapse]].

==Description==
''"Mnestia, we pray to you. For if the world had no song, there shall be no song-filled spring, and no forest will sprout blooms..."''

After cleansing both hands by the stream, then scooping out chilled wine as an offering to the god, the bards gather before the temple, bickering over who would receive Mnestia's blessed wreath. The three sisters of Parthia, renowned for their poems of love, demonstrate their song first. They are followed by an old man, Lupes, the poet with myriad mesmerizing metaphors. Lyrics of honeyed elegance do not move the goddess, the wine cup before them unmoving.

Until a wandering poet plucks the seven-stringed lyre in her hands, playing a tale written on ancient papyrus. Sand and winds from a millennia ago sweep across, and the story starts thus &mdash; In an age when many cities still existed in the world, a city was attacked by an evil dragon.

''"Lament for my homeland...''<br />''A monster dwells in its palatial hall, noble heirs becoming vile scoundrels,''<br />''All because of that giant dragon that breached the high tower,''<br />''Corrupting my ruler, devouring my kingdom's princess..."''

The wine is imbibed fully by the goddess, and the wandering poet becomes the owner of their wreath.
