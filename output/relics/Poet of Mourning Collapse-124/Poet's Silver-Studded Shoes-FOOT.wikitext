'''Poet's Silver-Studded Shoes''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Poet of Mourning Collapse]].

==Description==
''"The people know not where to seek Thanatos' trail, and there are legends that say no living can cross the River of Souls. Where, then, does the river flow?"''

"We have never heard of such a dragon, nor come across the existence of resurrection rituals in ancient tomes" &mdash; Some doubtful among the listeners voice out. The poet replies &mdash; She is not an offspring of the old cities, therefore not certain whether there was truly an evil dragon. This is merely what she heard from earlier bards, a poetic song imparted along generations only through words.

If no one passed down the songs, the history of the old cities would be truly buried in dust, and all would fade with time &mdash; The flourishing city-state of the past, deluged and devoured by the River of Souls, becoming a place disdained by even wild hounds and circling vultures. This is the curse left behind by the souls eaten by the evil dragon.

''"Lament for my homeland...''<br />''O Princess! Who would have imagined she was alchemied into the evil dragon's visage.''<br />''She devoured them all... the alchemist, the brave centurion, and the foolish king.''<br />''A feast fueled by bloodlust invited the shadows of death, the old city therefore annihilated..."''

Remember the name of the decimated city! This is a story about Styxia, played by the poet wearing silver-studded soles. She collects stories for the stories themselves, just like the words left behind by the silver studs on her woven shoes &mdash; ''"Remember the story. Forget me."''
