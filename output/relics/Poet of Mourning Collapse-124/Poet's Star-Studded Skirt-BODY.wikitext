{{Description|Dawn is the gentlest time of the day, her skirt is coincidentally also the colors of the last string of stars before dawn.}}
'''Poet's Star-Studded Skirt''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Poet of Mourning Collapse]].

==Description==
''"When Aquila opens their eyes, all the stars are asleep. Only one squinting night star remains, being the most curious."''

The narrative poem continues till the second cycle of day and night. More listeners gather around the poet, among them Kremnoans with quivers clinking with arrows, and those from Janusopolis who cast divining rods for godly advice. Since the black tide's encroachment across cities, countless historical records have been scattered, and the Grove's scholars have had little time to collect all the documents &mdash; many lesser cities did not even get the chance to leave their names behind.

Only the wandering poet knows that the old city occupied by the evil dragon once possessed the esoteric method of alchemy: With flesh as the foundation, everything could be created, and miracles could be performed. The alchemists spoke as such to the king, heartbroken from the tragic loss of his beloved daughter.

''"Lament for my homeland...''<br />''The silver-tongued alchemist was confident he could resurrect the princess from the dragon's flesh.''<br />''What is dead, yet undead. Another ten days pass.''<br />''The ritual is finally complete, alas..."''

The final nighttime star reluctantly closes its eyes, hankering to listen to the incomplete story of the children of humankind.
