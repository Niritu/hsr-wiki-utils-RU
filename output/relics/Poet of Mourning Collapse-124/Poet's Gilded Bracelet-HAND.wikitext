{{Description|A bracelet crafted from favored metal. The evil dragon in the story was once fettered in shackles made from this metal.}}
'''Poet's Gilded Bracelet''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Poet of Mourning Collapse]].

==Description==
''"People dug up gold from Georios' body, the first fearsome metal of its kind. And thus deceit and war were born."''

The origin of warfare has long since faded from time, and much of history has turned into legend. Yet, even as a legend, it is clear that arrogance, deceit, and avarice are the reasons for endless conflict among people, though gold takes the wrongful blame as its source. Just like those resplendent years untouched by strife, white iron and bronze were originally ritual offerings to gods. It was only later that they were cast off from altars and melted into armaments, becoming even more fearsome metals than gold.

The dragon in the story has been subjugated, right...? The wars among the cities are also near waning. The wandering poet's travels bring her to the holy city, where she plays the tale of the aftermath &mdash; After the evil dragon occupies the city, people rally dragon-hunting braves to rescue the princess.

''"Lament for my homeland...''<br />''The courageous centurion, with shackles forged in heavy gold, finally subjugates the evil dragon.''<br />''The old ruler's cries can be heard from the tower-top...''<br />''From the dragon's belly, only scant parts of the devoured princess are found, where only bones remain."''

The metal bracelet's tassels run across the lyre, emitting a crisp sigh.
