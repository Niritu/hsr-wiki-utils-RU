'''Band's Touring Bracelet''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Band of Sizzling Thunder]].

==Description==
Sizzling Thunder from Emerald-III quickly emblazed the whole planet's enthusiasm with several hits.

Marking the beginning of their concert tour were the dazzling sparkles of electrifying thunder when Daeve the rhythm guitarist fiercely struck chords, which coincidentally was also worshiped by hordes of their music fans as the only light in their lives.

In every concert tour the band had, there would be fans keeping order voluntarily and handing out wristbands to everyone upon entering the concert grounds. Most of these fans could not afford the costly fees for an escape, so accepting their fate and waiting for the electromagnetic burst to arrive was their only option. Ever since witnessing the return of these rebellious youths to the planet, they had felt it in their bones that their souls were ignited at this very moment. Onto these wristbands they wrote their lyrics, their showtime, as well as the band's unvoiced scream.

Sid the bassist collected the wristbands for every tour. His girlfriend wove them into a bracelet, which Sid then wore all the time.

"There's no meaning, no direction, nowhere else to go, and no future for us." From "Our Way," a single from Sizzling Thunder's second album, and Sid's life credo.
