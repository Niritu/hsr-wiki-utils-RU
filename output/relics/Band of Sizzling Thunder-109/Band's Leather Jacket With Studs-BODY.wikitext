{{Description|David, one of the band's lead singers, drew a white star on the back of this leather jacket and made it the cover of the band's final album.}}
'''Band's Leather Jacket With Studs''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Band of Sizzling Thunder]].

==Description==
The rock 'n' roll of Sizzling Thunder resounded through the planetary system, attracting involuntarily displaced youngsters to return to the crumbling Emerald-III.

Lead guitarist Jimmy brought the band underground. There they sang about the tragedy of planetary destruction, which echoed throughout the entire universe.

David printed the back of his leather jacket with a white star, or, more accurately, the white dwarf their star would become after the collapse. This would be their star's proof of existence. Those who left the planetary system and those who stayed behind all listened to that thunder-like rock 'n' roll and brandished the same striking symbol.

Despite ceasing to exist, their presence had been remixed into the music and carved into eternity.

"We'll burn with our life, 'cause the white star needs a spark to ignite." From "White Star," a single from Sizzling Thunder's final album of the same name. David wrote both the lyrics and the music.
