'''Band's Polarized Sunglasses''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Band of Sizzling Thunder]].

==Description==
The star's lifespan was plunging. Residents of Emerald-III fled their home planet before the red giant exploded.

Faced with a future of no escape, the elites took away hope, feigning ignorance to cries of desperation.

Janis' parents paid a massive amount of credits to board the ship, helplessly praying for an interstellar salvation. The explosion of the red giant would destroy the planet, and it would collapse into a white dwarf... Before the arrival of the imminent doom, escape was the only option. Janis, the Doctor of Chaos, however, decided to try her best to face the annihilation of her home system head-on, attempting to prove that the existence of her home would never perish.

As the dying sun burnt brighter, Janis took her mother's sunglasses and returned to the home planet with like-minded youngsters.

"Only cowards flee while shouting the name of the redeemer." Cited from "Cheap Salvation," the hit of Sizzling Thunder's first album, Janis reworded her angry words during a dispute with her parents into lyrics.
