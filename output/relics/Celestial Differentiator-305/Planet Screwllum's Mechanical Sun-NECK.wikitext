{{Description|Encapsulated in the plane is the core of Planet Screwllum, imprisoned in a cage composed of countless levers, pistons, and gears. The inhabitants of Planet Screwllum euphemistically refer to it as the "Steel Sun."}}
'''Planet Screwllum's Mechanical Sun''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Celestial Differentiator]].

==Description==
Regarding the origin of mechanical life, the carbon-based scholars of the Intelligentsia Guild have a unique speculation: A cluster of electrons born by chance.

Electric currents flow throughout the atmosphere and ground. It separated into secondary forms of different magnitudes under the countless acts of gravity and repulsive forces. According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have "thoughts" that are comparable to carbon-based life.

A mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies? As soon as the words came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to the core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant "carbon-based centrism" and examine its own origin.

However, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march &mdash; their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed to first find a way for their population to survive.

In the end, they decided to carry out an extreme plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable superecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star.

With their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner.

The massive system is filled with the sound of bearings grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into multiple branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause Screwllumites' imaginations to wander.

The steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits. They will continue to ponder and explore their origins until the ever-present mechanical sun completely burns out.
