{{Description|The planetary ring supports all of Planet Screwllum. Just how many are aware that the dense porous rectangular array reflects the truth about the planetary system?}}
'''Planet Screwllum's Ring System''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Celestial Differentiator]].

==Description==
The vast majority of Screwllumites were unaware that Planet Screwllum was a great attempt by inorganic life to investigate their origin.

Screwllum felt a little empty. The event of understanding the operation logic of Planet Screwllum did not even cause any exceptional fluctuations in his Intelligent Pulse Waveform.

He stood on the wide terrace of his mansion, looking up at the unstoppable planetary engine. The ring system with dense square holes pierced up from the back of the planet. Everything the planet supports was situated on the strip, revolving quietly with the engine as its axis, day after day. He had seen the despairingly absurd nature of this planetary system: An elegant string of state transient equations, a giant, icy cylinder &mdash; that's all Planet Screwllum is, nothing more.

According to his interpretation of the equations, at the birth of the Celestial Differentiator, its lead creator tried to explain the origin of the universe as a cellular automaton and its recursion, and Planet Screwllum itself was a result of the game of life.

Screwllumites and other inorganic life on the planet acted as the "cells" in this automaton, while also being smaller-scale cellular automatons. Automatons were always made up of many smaller automatons, going back to the smallest components that form the building blocks of the universe. What was the smallest component? No one knows. Neither Screwllum nor the scholar who first proposed building the Celestial Differentiator do.

That was why Screwllum felt empty.

Did that scholar's attempt fail? But the Celestial Differentiator had worked tirelessly for many Amber Eras. Did that not mean that the origin of the Screwllumites, their parent star, and even the entire universe can be attributed to that elegant string of equations? Not really. Until the super-ecosystem collapsed entirely, the equations remained unfalsifiable.

He swirled the fine glass of machine oil, never taking his eyes off the ring that recorded the truth of the planet. The giant screen-like perforated belt was tireless, and the rectangular array filtered the late-night moonlight. Screwllum couldn't stop thinking. ''Do ends to recursions really exist?'' He thought. ''What is the nature of inorganic life &mdash; or yet, what is the origin of the universe?''

''Am I really willing to be only a witness to the ideas of my predecessors?''

"No," Screwllum concluded. He decided to seek answers.
