'''Guard's Shining Gauntlets''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Guard of Wuthering Snow]].

==Description==
After the invaders carrying the marks of Destruction cut off the guard unit's retreat, Laszlo Landau ordered his troops to protect the Supreme Guardian and escape while he stayed behind to hold off the enemy.

Even the most valiant captain among the Silvermane Guards could not retreat unscathed from the swarms of monsters.

The terrifying cries and ferocious assaults of the twisted monsters were unrelenting. Despite their incessant charges, none of these monstrosities managed to break the lone defense line set up by Landau. The unending fierce battles gradually exhausted Laszlo, but he managed to hold on until reinforcements finally showed up. It was only then that he collapsed into unconsciousness. The soldiers found out that Laszlo had lost both of his hands in the battle.

The Architects' best blacksmith forged a pair of exquisite gauntlets to bestow upon the hero, such that he may once again hold up the Silvermane Guards banner.

"The only regret," Laszlo lamented to himself as he marveled at the gauntlets, "is that I will no longer be able to feel the vibration of the bow."
