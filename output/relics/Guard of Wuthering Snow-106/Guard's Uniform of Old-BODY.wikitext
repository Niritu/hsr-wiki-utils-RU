'''Guard's Uniform of Old''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Guard of Wuthering Snow]].

==Description==
An old-fashioned Silvermane Guard uniform passed down for generations in the Goethe family. This uniform has long been buried at the bottom of a chest, and only a soldier's honor might be worthy of its return to the world.

As the soldiers of Destruction marched ever closer, the Silvermane Guards swore to defend the last barrier even when there was no possibility of a retreat.

During the Defense of Vevalo, Horace Goethe led his squad in the months-long defense of a key mountain pass. When the trumpets of arriving reinforcements finally sounded in the valley, that valiant company of heroes was long gone, and even their remains were nowhere to be found. At the commendation ceremony, Supreme Guardian Alisa pinned a medal of honor on Horace Goethe's young son. The boy stood upright in this old-fashioned uniform, representing those who had made the ultimate sacrifice.

The young Goethe junior saw uniforms and medals on that day, but the Supreme Guardian saw so much more. She witnessed the greatest legacy left behind by heroes &mdash; the future of Belobog.

"Horace Goethe was a true warrior. You should be proud to bear the Goethe name." This was the young Goethe's only memory of the Supreme Guardian.
