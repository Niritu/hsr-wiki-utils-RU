{{Description|Encapsulated in the plane is the Insumousu Autonomous Region of Thalassa. The Xianzhou Daiyu had crashed here, inspiring the civilization of Insumousu.}}
'''Insumousu's Whalefall Ship''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Broken Keel]].

==Description==
"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens."

Firstly, there was a shadow beyond the atmosphere, then a fiery glow as it entered the layers of air. At the end, its full form was revealed &mdash; It was a grand palace, a heavenly wonder beyond even the combined skill of all of Insumousu's greatest artisans. It descended slowly, as if it had condensed from the heavens themselves. Insumousu's ocean was vast, but could it truly contain this celestial palace fallen from the skies? No one knew for certain.

"Amidst the chaos, some dispersed and fled in all directions. Others remained in the villages on land and under the sea, anticipating the descent of the Divine Fall."

The fallen Xianzhou Daiyu crashed onto the surface of Thalassa, leaving a deep watery crater in the heart of the Insumousu sea. For seven planetary days, the world trembled, while the magnificent ruins stood silently on the sea bed like the tragic and magnificent remains of a god. The survivors of Insumousu, living in their abodes in the sea bed, witnessed how their beloved homes were shattered by the celestial palace from beyond. Yet, with joy and elation, they soon found a new home in the remnants of the Daiyu after the Divine Fall.

As living conditions improved, the people of Insumousu had more time and energy to think. They finally had the opportunity to ask the most important questions as they gazed upon the magnificent ruins that descended from the heavens: Who were "they"? And from whence did "they" come?

In the days of old, the people of Insumousu knew not the art of metallurgy, nor had they yet invented written language. Thus, they turned to imagination to supplement their knowledge, and sought to understand all through the telling of stories. "Legends" were born as stories passed through the generations, turning into "myths" over time. "Myths" then shaped cognition as they themselves endure the flow of time &mdash; until "civilization" was born. As centuries passed and stars shifted in the sky, Thalassa became a trade partner of the Xianzhou Alliance. It was then that the aquatic people of Insumousu set foot inside the "celestial palace" for the first time. There, they beheld the complete grandeur of the Xianzhou, and at last learned the truth behind the Divine Fall.

The well-educated Insumousu gentry always regarded themselves as a continuation of the Daiyu. "What the Daiyu once followed, we should follow. What the Daiyu once fought against, we should also fight." When they tell stories from the past, they would still begin with these words:

"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens."
