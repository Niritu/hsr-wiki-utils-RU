{{Description|The fallen Xianzhou Daiyu is forever anchored in a foreign land. Perhaps it is time to untie its mooring ropes and let it return home.}}
'''Insumousu's Frayed Hawser''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Broken Keel]].

==Description==
As the people of Insumousu became enlightened by civilization, they longer see the broken ship's deceased crew as fallen gods. However, their reverence remains unchanged. Insumousu's poets thus sing: "The ocean may swallow mortals, yet their spirits live on forevermore."

In accordance with the calendar of Insumousu, the second day of rest in the Month of Tides is Divine Fall Day &mdash; when the water dwellers recite scriptures, consume herbs, and perform bizarre dances along the current in honor of the fallen "gods" who brought a blessing to Insumousu. In modern times, Divine Fall Day gradually lost its original religious meaning &mdash; songs replace scriptures, delicacies replace herbs, and only the peculiar dances remain to this day as a cultural heritage.

In the past few hundred Star Calendar years, Insumousu has been generous in sharing its unique culture with the outside world, and the form of Divine Fall Day has quietly undergone more changes.

Insumousu's land cities are usually full of young people, prone to staying up all night singing and dancing during Divine Fall Day. Foreign visitors, especially Xianzhou tourists, often choose to join in the festivities. Foreigners frequently fall in love with the vibrant atmosphere of the cities, these places filled with fiery passion as unstoppable as tsunamis. As the water dwellers grow out of their adolescent years, their lungs would gradually shrink, their necks metamorphose into gills, and their hands, feet, and eyes become more suited for underwater life. The poets always say, "The people of Insumousu give their noisy and boisterous youth to the land, and their quiet and solemn old age to the ocean."

With the support of Xianzhou's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration &mdash; People would dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system.

Through their discovery of the history of the Daiyu, the people of Insumousu also learned of the tragedy behind its fall. When the Xianzhou Daiyu was irreparably damaged and breaking apart, Qingzhu, leader of the Daiyu, made the courageous decision to sacrifice herself and the entire ship to end the curse of the immortality plague. The Xianzhou Alliance hopes that the fallen heroes will receive a dignified soul-soothing ceremony and the people of Insumousu, who were spared from the disaster, have given their response.

At some point during the night of Divine Fall Day, the revelry would come to an abrupt halt. Adolescents, children, and Xianzhou residents would sit by the shore as adults emerge from the water and solemnly gaze at the oceanic horizon. Then, several starskiffs break through the water and fly from the bottom of the sea toward the star.

The starskiffs are each inscribed with a row of beautiful Insumousu calligraphy that reads, "You should undo the ropes for drowned sailors. Don't cry. You can sail safely after my demise."
