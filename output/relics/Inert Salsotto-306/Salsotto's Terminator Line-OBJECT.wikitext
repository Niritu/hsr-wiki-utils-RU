{{Description|Planet Salsotto's own rotation stopped, and thus each cycle of its day and night seemed to last forever. People can only gain the bare minimum space for survival when they ceaselessly migrated and closely chased the ever-moving terminator line.}}
'''Salsotto's Terminator Line''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Inert Salsotto]].

==Description==
Ever since the stagnation caused by the Meteoric Starfall, the terminator line had become the lifeline of the Salsottians.

When it all started, people still took the shifting of day and night for granted. The line of dawn and dusk swept across the earth, climbed over mountains and ravines, brought dawn to those still awake, and sent sunset to those who would soon sleep... But when the rhythm of light and darkness slowed down, day and night were no longer familiar, and the seemingly eternal heat and coldness were like the quagmire of hell, slowly burying all lives entrapped within. This was why the Salsottian people, barely surviving at the time, boarded the floating mobile city and began their chase with dawn and dusk.

Climbing atop the observation deck of the mobile city of Tumbleweed and looking in the direction that they were moving, daylight lies ahead and dark night behind.

The pursuit of "Tumbleweed" is not only for survival but also for a dignified life. When it moved faster than the terminator line, then the early morning light would march into the afternoon; when slower than the terminator line, then the dusk light would fade into the late night. In this way, the naturally optimistic Salsottian managed to restore every day to its original state. The romance in their bloodline blessed them with the easygoing spirit to sing leisurely in peaceful afternoons and sleep soundly on starry nights.

However, this voyage of tenacity and perseverance would, at last, come to its final downfall, and the ruins of the once mobile city were eventually left far behind by the ever-shifting terminator line.

Years later, the two moving cities that had never met each other would finally stand against each other, with their respective turrets among the wreckage still aimed in opposition. One of the two cities must have crossed half of the planet to the other one and started the initial incursion. Traces of brutal warfare between the two cities were still occasionally discernible under the sand dunes, which merged with unnameable hatred and morphed together into the same ruins.

Planet Salsotto kept its silence. And ever since a certain unknown time, the duration of each of its rotation cycles had somehow gradually decreased, ushering in its own self-healing in an unpopulated future.
