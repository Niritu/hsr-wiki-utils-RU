{{Description|The fiery propulsion armor gives Glamoth's Iron Cavalry a flame hot enough to ignite the battlefield.}}
'''Iron Cavalry's Silvery Armor''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Iron Cavalry Against the Scourge]].

==Description==
Several arcs of intense fire streak across the night sky, surpassing the horizon where dawn rises, heading toward different star sectors of Glamoth &mdash; a routine that the residents of the Republic are most familiar with and also most terrified of.

Silver-tinged armors soar through the skies, racing against time to reach the devastated battlefields, too preoccupied to gaze down at the views they tirelessly guard day and night.

The Empress' orders brook no argument. Identical-looking warriors are birthed from the incubators, swearing allegiance to the Empress and to reclaim Glamoth's skies. The Iron Cavalry traverse through the mountains of corpses and seas of flying insectoids' blood, burning the charred remnants of the vermin's shells, shattering their colossal jaws and toothy remnants... The fate of Glamoth's Iron Cavalry is to endure the slow disintegration of entropy, burning fiercely on the threshold between life and death.

Until the flames are completely extinguished, until the insectoids that blot out the sky turn into ashen black earth, until no one remains alive &mdash; such a daily routine would continue...

What does it mean to be alive? As the acceleration of the propelled armor tightly clamps down on their chests and as the piercing pain of entropy-induced numbness briefly surfaces on their bodies, they would taste a brief hint of what it means to be alive.
