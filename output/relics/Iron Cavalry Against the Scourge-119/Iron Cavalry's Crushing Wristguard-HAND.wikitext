{{Description|A powerful iron wristguard that can crush insectoids. It is sharp and light while being hard and sturdy.}}
'''Iron Cavalry's Crushing Wristguard''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Iron Cavalry Against the Scourge]].

==Description==
Glamoth's Iron Cavalry clenches their wrists tight, causing the filthy carapaces of the Swarm to crack open, allowing the corrosive fluid from their abdomens to spray freely. When the insectoid fluid touches their silvery armor, it vaporises instantly, leaving only stains of filth and blood.

The wreckage of armor and insectoid limbs scatter as deep-space debris. Around Glamoth, the "River of Death" flowes silently under the pull of gravity, marking the end of the bloody battle.

The leaders of the council discuss the post-war situation, passing judgment on Titania, who had never wielded real power. It is because of her control over the Iron Cavalry, whose power rivaled that of the Swarm. She is the greatest threat to the Republic's continued survival... People ring the bells of peace, declaring to the populace that the Swarm had dispersed, and the azure sky would return to the hands of the Republic.

''"If we do not restrain the 'Empress,' who else can control these weapons?"''

The Iron Cavalry ceaselessly hone their iron fists' strength in their brief lives. But they never imagined that those pale feeble hands in the council, lifting high, would possess the power to change Glamoth's fate.
