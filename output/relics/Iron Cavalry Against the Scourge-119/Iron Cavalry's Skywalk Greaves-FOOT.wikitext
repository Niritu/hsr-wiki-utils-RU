{{Description|Mechanical greaves that combine destructive capacities with speed. They allow Glamoth's Iron Cavalry to leap high and concentrate their strength into a kick directed at a single point on the enemy.}}
'''Iron Cavalry's Skywalk Greaves''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Iron Cavalry Against the Scourge]].

==Description==
The Iron Cavalry's tracks spread across every corner of Glamoth's "Empire" like blazing meteors, yet they cannot escape the "dream" woven by Titania.

The people of the Republic worry about the legion born for war, questioning how much overlap there truly is between the "Empire" that never existed and the territories that the ordinary people are familiar with...

The Empress bestows honor and faith upon her knights, and the Iron Cavalry offers loyalty and commitment to the Empress... New humans are continuously birthed from incubators and given numbers and missions, while old humans hide beneath steel barriers, anxiously enjoying the long-awaited peace they yearned for. The deception of peace needs to be exposed by someone, and that particular method of war that shook the very foundation of humanity should not exist in the world. When the catastrophe fades, people with fear in their hearts then want to destroy the distorted products of war completely...

The Iron Cavalry's greaves break through the sky. As long as they are willing, they can reach any star.

However, the "Empire" is nowhere to be found. Before the Iron Cavalry lies only a predetermined path &mdash; one end leading to death, the other to themselves.
