'''Watchmaker's Telescoping Lens''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Watchmaker, Master of Dream Machinations]].

==Description==
In the stories about the Watchmaker in Penacony, he always possesses a unique insight that allows him to easily discern business opportunities beneath the dreamy bubbles, and create grandiose enterprises that none have thought of.

The frontier prison earned its freedom amidst the Cancer of All Worlds, and welcomed peace and prosperity under the radiance of The Family. It is said that was when the Watchmaker entered the fray. His eyepiece reflected the essence of this Dreamscape &mdash; People spend like wastrels in the Moment of Dusk only to "seek the impossible in dreams." From then on, Penacony's dreams started to contain many incredulous objects: Teapots that can tell jokes, race cars that twirl as they drive, and mansions that switch their location every day... Most of them are utterly useless, however they are being sold at astronomical prices. And those who visit from afar are willing to toss mountains of cash for them.

This is a fantastical Dreamscape, so why not indulge in madness? The words "Exclusive and only in the dream" are enough to redefine the worth of luxuries in the Dreamscape.

The Alfalfa Family and old Dreamchasers from the commercial world often feel regret about this, lamenting that they did not spot these opportunities at earlier times. The Watchmaker simply saw a bit further than them &mdash; Just a bit further every time.
