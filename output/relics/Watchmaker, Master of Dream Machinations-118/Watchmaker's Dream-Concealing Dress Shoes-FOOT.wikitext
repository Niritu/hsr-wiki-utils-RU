'''Watchmaker's Dream-Concealing Dress Shoes''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Watchmaker, Master of Dream Machinations]].

==Description==
The Watchmaker has trodden over every inch of the Dreamscape and also across the annals of Penacony's history. His name has been talked about for centuries in this land of the dreams, and Dreamchasers of today can still hear of his whereabouts.

People start to suspect whether the Watchmaker is one person, a group, or a lie woven by The Family.

Some Dreamchasers swear to unveil the truth about the Watchmaker. They head to various Dreamscapes to seek traces of the mysterious mogul, only to gain nothing but mirages &mdash; A mysterious guest at a certain business negotiation, a masterless brand that soared into unexpected success, a huge investment with no traceable source... Every time they try to deduce that the Watchmaker does not exist, they are proving that the Watchmaker is everywhere in the dream.

Books about the Watchmaker fill the bookshelves in the Primal Waking Library. His name forever envelops Penacony.

The more people want to discover the truth, the more they will be blinded by lies... Amidst the thousands of legends and rumors, this superstar of the festivities will only leave his footprints, but never his face.
