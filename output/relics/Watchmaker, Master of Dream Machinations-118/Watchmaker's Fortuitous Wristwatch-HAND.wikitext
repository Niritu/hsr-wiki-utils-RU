{{Description|A wristwatch of fine craftsmanship. It contains a unique watch face and clock hands. It is said to be the symbol of good luck in the Dreamscape.}}
'''Watchmaker's Fortuitous Wristwatch''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Watchmaker, Master of Dream Machinations]].

==Description==
Why the Watchmaker is called "the Watchmaker" is the biggest puzzle in this serialized story.

Some say he was once a craftsman at a clocktower. Some say he was once a merchant who sold timepieces. There are even those who say his head is shaped like a watch face &mdash; Just like Clockie, which he created.

As rumors abound, the wristwatches in the dream soared in popularity with the Watchmaker's fame. The Dreamchasers know these watches have nothing to do with the esteemed man, yet still regard the watches as a way to show their respect for him and a symbol of good fortune. Due to the promotion of many commercial activities, the clock symbol became the most ubiquitous thing in Penacony &mdash; Clothes, accessories, food... From graffiti in the alleys to the giant timepieces in the hotel lobbies, the influence of this legendary mogul can be seen anywhere.

"Who wouldn't like clocks in Penacony?"

The real Watchmaker seems to have assented to this and never expressed any opinions against that initial wristwatch design, till the clock symbol just became another fact of life in Penacony, till no one ever asked about the origin of the Watchmaker again.
