{{Description|A splendid and luxurious formal suit with leather collars. It is magnificent and elegant, usually reserved for formal occasions such as feasts.}}
'''Watchmaker's Illusory Formal Suit''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Watchmaker, Master of Dream Machinations]].

==Description==
In the various legends in Penacony, the Watchmaker has very diverse identities and appearances.

In these rootless fables, he is sometimes a kind old gentleman, an elegant lady, and even a giant gentleman hundreds of feet tall... however, no matter the version of the story, he is always magnificently dressed.

Legends say that the Watchmaker will share his secret with his dance partner at the Dreamscape where dusk and dawn intertwines. Hearing this, people eagerly join the dance floor and invite every single mysterious guest hidden in the lavishly-dressed crowd &mdash; More and more Dreamchasers meet each other in this way and the ball gradually becomes a place to socialize for friendships and love. The expensive tickets are always sold out upon release. Even if the master dressed to the nines from legends never appeared, it did not hinder the passion with which the guests sought an encounter with him.

"Your outfit... could you be the famous Watchmaker?" This question went from what was initially a genuine query to an expression of flattery, finally becoming a code phrase for an invitation to a dance.

The Watchmaker gained a new business of hosting balls, and the Dreamscape had an extra dash of romance and passion added to it.
