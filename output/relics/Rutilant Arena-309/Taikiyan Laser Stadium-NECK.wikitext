{{Description|Encapsulated in the plane is the most advanced arena on Planet Taikiyan &mdash; the Taikiyan Stadium. The atmosphere is lively both inside and outside the dome as flags wave in the air. With all eyes on the arena, an exciting game of Roboball is about to kick off.}}
'''Taikiyan Laser Stadium''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Rutilant Arena]].

==Description==
Planet Taikiyan was once an IPC scuttle site for spaceships, where value assessors were dispatched to clean up old ship wreckage for any remaining value.

Assessors regarded an assignment to station in Planet Taikiyan as an exile with no return. On this tiny planet, mountains of carbon fiber and stainless steel traced the pre-decommissioned outlines of giant ships, casting a shadow of emptiness over the steel ruins. Out here, the exiles' desire to be recalled intensified to a boiling point. Assessors wearing propulsion equipment fought for high-quality parts below-deck for many years, their lightning-fast figures mutually fleeing from and in pursuit of each other in the corridors of sunken ships. They had formed their own underground rules in the shadows... And yet none of these trapped beasts had their wishes fulfilled. No one was ever able to return.

The rules established by these abandoned humans, reduced to caged animals, did not escape the IPC's surveillance. Footage from their wearable cameras were transmitted back to the IPC and passed as after-dinner laughingstock by the high and powerful. The investor of the Traditional Project Department, however, scented out the faint possibility for "entertainment" after some consideration.

With this new plan, the first competition in the cosmos featuring the Taikiyan Roboball would have its glorious debut on planet Taikiyan. Several planet terraforming machines descended to the surface and yanked out the decommissioned spaceships in their entirety, not leaving a single inch of their former shadows behind. The obscure little planet had been transformed by the sport of Roboball, becoming a dazzling athletic hub in the blink of an eye. "No one will care about its ludicrous beginnings by that time. There will only be pure sportsmanship and high-value commercial agreements."

The competition had athletes wearing propulsion equipment and armor, ever-changing three-dimensional race tracks, and physical clashes that sent sparks flying... The attention of the entire cosmos was thoroughly captured the moment the Roboball Competition was announced. From that moment forth, the planet once shrouded in darkness has never again seen a moment of night.

Both the home and visitor teams are evenly matched in the massive stadium, and the vociferous audience fills up the dome in countless multitudes. They roar the names of the team and the players, giving birth to a thunderous cacophony that does not end. Outside the dome, the planet is also bustling with activity as broadcast licenses, exclusive sponsorship, and advertising contracts are fought over in the trading market, while underground betting is rife as excitement and disappointment share the spotlight in equal measure... The inky shade of the night has long been transformed into a silent radium backdrop to the overflowing lights of the stadium.

The Taikiyan Stadium has been bright as day from the moment of its inauguration, and no one even remembers where the begone shadows are now hidden.
