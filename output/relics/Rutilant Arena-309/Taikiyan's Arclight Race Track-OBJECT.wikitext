A large amount of transparent polycarbonate material was used in the construction of the stadium to give the audience an unobstructed view of the games.}}
'''Taikiyan's Arclight Race Track''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Rutilant Arena]].

==Description==
The Traditional Project Department invited sport experts from Interastral Peace Entertainment and requested that they remove all savage elements of Taikiyan's underground rules and transform it into a lucrative competition.

Material experts designed a Roboball to satisfy the request &mdash; a high-tech iron ball with a diameter of 35 centimeters, weighing 30 kilograms, and of carbon fiber and stainless steel. It constantly chases alterations of the Phase Flame, increasing the unpredictability of the game through its irregular movements. Sports equipment experts followed that by developing a standard-issue propulsion protective armor for Roboball games, allowing top sport equipment and medical organizations to better demonstrate their quality and ensuring the sustainability of a stable income and safe competition.

And thus, the Taikiyan Roboball Association was formally established, and the initial version of the Taikiyan Roboball Game Rules was formulated. The game system comprising two teams with seven players each was also established from then on.

The track architects of the Intelligentsia Guild had turned the concept of "racing" into a three-dimensional circular track &mdash; the standard length of which is 2.91 kilometers. The flat central area of the track is 5 meters wide, and the curved areas on both sides range from 2 to 14 meters in width. The Roboball players will fly unidirectionally for several laps on the spacious and bright track, accompanied by the sound of whistling and collision, completing the entire game. According to actual testing, during high-speed travel on the track, disconnected point light sources will connect into lines with the athletes' visual persistence, and several dimly visible lumens will form an exclusive arclight track. Interastral Peace Entertainment invited the wealthy to participate in the league, promising them the exposure their favorite sport deserved. Subsequently, the league clubs were established, and the most talented players were assembled and ready to go.

Interastral Peace Media had exclusive broadcasting rights for the event and, with the help of ultraremote sensing technology, they broadcasted the live competition far and wide. The sensory experience of top athletes was also recorded throughout the event, allowing homebound viewers to also experience the speed, collisions, whistles, and arclights of the competition from the comfort of their own homes. The old scuttling site was filled with sightseeing cruises and bustling crowds gathered in the streets, illuminated by lights and advertisements, slowly streaming into the stadium. They confirmed their seats, looked around, and were greeted with banners, flags, and airborne malt foam. The bright track stood silently under the spotlights.

Amid the roar of the crowd, the first game began.
