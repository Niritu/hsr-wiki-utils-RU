{{Description|Boxing headgear that provides excellent protection. It perfectly fits the shape of the owner's face.}}
'''Champion's Headgear''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Champion of Streetwise Boxing]].

==Description==
Having grown up on the streets, Lindsay had never thought of boxing in official matches for she never believed she could be defeated by anyone, let alone someone who already has a foot in the grave.

The old lady calling herself a boxing coach provided Lindsay with a full set of protective gear and challenged the young girl to a bout, demanding Lindsay to train under her if the old lady managed a win.

Lindsay was too proud to use the complicated protective gears and tossed them all aside. She thought she could rely on her quick reactions for an easy win, but the old lady got near her in three strides and landed a blow straight to her face. When Lindsay regained consciousness, she picked up the boxing headgear she had tossed aside. Through the narrow opening of the headgear, she saw a brand-new world.

"So, these are the fists of a true boxer, huh? Interesting. If you want teach me, then train me to be the strongest boxer that ever lived."

Though a bit begrudgingly, Lindsay accepted that she had lost the bet. Now, wearing protective equipment for the first time, she officially stepped into the world of boxing.
