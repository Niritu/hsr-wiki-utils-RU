{{Description|This is a stretch of wire scavenged from the junkyard. Despite bits of its insulation falling off, there is still some use left in it. No such thing as useless trash exists in Talia's small bandit towns.}}
'''Talia's Exposed Electric Wire''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Talia: Kingdom of Banditry]].

==Description==
This exposed wire was old. It had once been neatly lined up on a starship until one hasty escape attempt of the starship led to a huge shock wave, which subsequently exposed the wire to the moisture in the air.

The entire starship was dragged into a labyrinth of underground passages. On the thieves' starship, shields made of steel plates were removed layer by layer, and the power lines were crudely stripped apart, all of which were then used to build the first-ever alliance market. The thieves there began to accumulate wealth and at the same time started to talk about their ideals. Soon after, the protracted infighting began, where suspicion and betrayal were expressed by and against one another. The flames of the war fought between the dictator and their detractors eventually spread from the underground tunnel to the surface-level desert grounds...

This exposed wire was even older. It was dug out of a pothole by the bandits and then connected to a revamped overland vehicle with air leaking in from all directions, which was driven to a distant water source.

The top priority for all survivors of the war of betrayal was to locate Talia's water sources. They drove thousands of miles a day on deserts littered with glass shards in extremely shabby and poorly made vehicles. The caravans of the bandits sometimes chased each other, raising dust and heavy smoke, and other times they just wantonly threw people on or off the car... The sheer pressure of survival forced them to give up all other thoughts. Only by forging ahead could they be saved from confusion.

This naked wire was always old. It was further removed from the overland vehicle and placed into the town's lightbox by the bandits. The aging wire caused the lights to flicker frequently.

It was an old gangster who claimed to be the "police officer" who founded the original Nailscrap Town. With his strongarm tactics and charisma, he managed to keep the junkyard in good order. The town became livelier than ever. Eccentric engineers accidentally made machinery out of waste, and desperate wastelanders also enjoyed fighting back and forth in the underground arena... Late at night in a bar, they filled their glasses with grape juice that smelled like gasoline and cheered together, celebrating the fact that they had managed yet another day of survival.

There was nothing new in Talia, just old things repurposed differently in changing times.
