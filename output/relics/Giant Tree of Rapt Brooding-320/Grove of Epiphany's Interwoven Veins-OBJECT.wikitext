'''Grove of Epiphany's Interwoven Veins''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Giant Tree of Rapt Brooding]].

==Description==
Each thought of the Grove of Epiphany is like a branch on the giant tree. The veins form hundreds of viewpoints, expanding like an intricate web of young boughs. Though independent, they intertwine, ultimately forming the thriving canopy of the great tree.

One branch pointed its leaf stalk toward itself, twisting in intricate coils. The Ascetics of Lotophagism were captivated by the very patterns of the tree's leaves and flowers, believing that all life and even the cosmos were visible, tangible realities. Their practice was not merely asceticism for its own sake, but a method of harmonizing all things &mdash; seeing asceticism not as the denial of self, but as a direct path to understanding it.

Another branch bore heavy fruit, filling the boughs. Scholars of Caprism specialized in the study, breeding, and preservation of animals. The many forms of the chimeras, both pitiful and beautiful, were their small but meaningful experiment to understanding the vast diversity of life.

One branch twisted into a perfect proportion, precise and elegant. The scholars of Nodism asserted that "all things are numbers," believing everything could be mapped mathematically. As one of the earliest schools to form in the Grove, they imposed strict standards, proclaiming "No scholar who is ignorant of geometry may enter" and regarded mathematics as the very means by which {{Rubi|Cerces|Reason Titan}} governs the world.

Another branch grew thick and resilient, sturdy and enduring. Helkolithism required the scholars to prove their discipline by swinging a sling before admission, casting stones beyond a specific range. This was a test to demonstrate their commitment to "perfectionism" in thought, physical rigor, and competitive spirit.

One branch alternated between drooping and standing tall, transmitting an exquisite beauty to the senses. The Erythrokeramists view art and sensibility as the core of logical thinking, believing that the rawest and most refined knowledge comes from direct sensory experience, leading to a more enlightened and profound understanding of the world.

High above, in the lush treetop, one branch devoted and worshipful stood closest to the heart of the giant tree. This branch was the most suited for ritual. The Venerationists excelled in the understanding of Titan ceremonies and the deployment of divine miracles, earning the nickname "The Cradle of Amphoreus' Politicians." They not only governed the Grove's sacred rites but also influenced the very fabric of Amphoreus' politics. However, there was a new and sharp young shoot, rising in opposition...

The Nousporist inherited the First Scholar's teachings on the soul, and specialized in the transformation and ascension of life and matter. It was the youngest school, yet with the most cutting-edge arguments, focused on tracing the origins of all life and material existence.

The Seven Sages of the Seven Schools each presided over their respective fields of study, with no hierarchy among them. The towering giant tree of reason, the symbolic head of the Seven Sages, spread knowledge and reason like branches, scattering them across the world amid endless debates and intellectual discourse.
