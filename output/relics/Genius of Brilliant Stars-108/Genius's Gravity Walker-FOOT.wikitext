{{Description|A wearable gravity-capture device. It is shaped like a pair of ice skates that reflects the stars' twinkling lights during quick gliding.}}
'''Genius's Gravity Walker''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Genius of Brilliant Stars]].

==Description==
The notorious Dr. Primitive, member 64, had spent his life running away from interstellar pursuers for the great crimes he had committed.

Dr. Primitive seemed to enjoy the thrill of being pursued, always keeping a carefully managed distance from those who were hunting him, never too close to be caught nor too far to be untraceable.

He applied some kind of gravity-capture technology to his escape where he was able to use gravity to wander freely across space. Astrophysicists from the Intelligentsia Guild could not understand the principles of this technology, so they merely assumed that it was something to do with the gravitational potential difference between stars. His pursuers riding in vehicles of the gravity era struggled to catch up to his speed, swearing to bring him to justice.

"Watching someone spacewalking should've been a feast for the eyes," a Galaxy Ranger said. "Too bad, that 'someone' is Dr. Primitive."

The Galaxy Ranger still refused to believe in Dr. Primitive's presumptive death and continued the hunt for him even after he had completely vanished.
