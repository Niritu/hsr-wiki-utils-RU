{{Description|Diving-suit-like attire that envelops the body when activated, sending neural signals from your whole body to the metafield in real time.}}
'''Genius's Metafield Suit''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Genius of Brilliant Stars]].

==Description==
The metafield space created by Sserkal, member 29, transcended biological race and multiple dimensions. Any living creature could synchronize its neural signals into the consciousness network, simply with the help of a diving suit.

For these creatures that were unable to travel between worlds, this collective dream domain granted them a chance to connect with one another and seek peace and tranquility that were non-existent in the real world.

Within this metafield of virtual data, these creatures created countless cultural assets, and a new order was quietly established. Just when it looked like this virtual eden would finally replace reality, Sserkal the Net Weaver of all Creation cut off the connection to the consciousness network, as if it had been one big joke. The entire metafield suddenly sank into silence.

"All those investors who would yammer about metafield space all day have all gone mad. The industry has been empowered countless times, but now the metafield is gone."

People are prone to any supposition when they lose something. The metafield might have been designed to be a petri dish for the soul. Inviting creatures of various kinds might just be a ruse for getting free soul samples.
