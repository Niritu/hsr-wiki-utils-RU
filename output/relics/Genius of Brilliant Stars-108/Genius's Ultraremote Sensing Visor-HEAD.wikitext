{{Description|A pair of communication goggles embedded with ultraremote sensing technology that breaks through the shackles of limited transmission and remote distances.}}
'''Genius's Ultraremote Sensing Visor''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Genius of Brilliant Stars]].

==Description==
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that among members of the Genius Society, there is an overabundance of eccentricity and a lack of communication.

Social interaction is indeed a burden for most people, even more so for geniuses traveling between worlds.

Elias Salas, member 56 and the second head of the Genius Society once tried to resolve this problem. He ardently prepared communication goggles equipped with ultraremote sensing capabilities for all members. Although he succeeded in establishing a bridge between the most distant of stars, few were willing to connect. Thus, the universe's greatest-ever communication device was never fully utilized.

"'Da numba you hab dialed is not in sewvice.' Can't you just show a bit more commitment when you pretend to be an AI...?"

Elias Salas sighed and understood that this indeed was a huge ask. But he's got to give it a try, believing his technology would one day have its use one way or another.
