'''Genius's Frequency Catcher''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Genius of Brilliant Stars]].

==Description==
"How to slack off at work without being noticed" was an ongoing problem for Stephen Lloyd, 84th member of the Genius Society, who was living in his foster father's fruit store.

He made a pair of gloves that could capture specific frequencies and the escaping sound and light, allowing himself the pleasure of researching the stringed instruments behind the frequency fence.

This technology could capture and confine all light and sounds within the designated area, and was simply inexplicable within the current confines of Aiden classic sciences. It was indeed an outstanding invention that could change the course of science to say the least, but Stephen had no interest in introducing this technology to the public. After all, to him, it was just a toy he made to loaf on the job.

"Stephen, I don't know exactly what you've done, but you're definitely slacking off, right?"

Even though Stephen Lloyd was celebrated as a genius among geniuses, to his foster father, Stephen was just a child that liked fantasizing and goofing around.
