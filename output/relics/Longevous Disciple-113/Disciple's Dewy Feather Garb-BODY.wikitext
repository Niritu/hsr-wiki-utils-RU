{{Description|A feather garb made according to old scrolls. Its owner was either a demon reviled in the pages of history or a savior of humanity.}}
'''Disciple's Dewy Feather Garb''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Longevous Disciple]].

==Description==
Searching for information in fragments of historical texts is particularly difficult for the blind. Her companions read the vast amount of ancient texts to her indiscriminately, and she compiled and excerpted the sentences in order to explore the mysteries within.

With her extraordinary intelligence, she can remember most of the passages after only listening to them once. However, she listened repeatedly to the ''The Witch in Robe of Feather'' ghost story unearthed from a scroll pile, never growing bored by it.

According to the legend, a certain delvemaster saved her partner by placing their soul into a bird, granting them immortality. However, she eventually could not resist the call of the avian and also transformed into a bird, flying alongside them. Over time, the delvemaster became confused and lost her true form, becoming a half-feathered, half-human monster. When her subjects stormed the palace and pierced her with blazing spears and arrows, the two birds sang a final mournful song and turned to ashes together.

She loved this story so much that she took the essence and marrow of birds and transformed them in the alchemical furnace, then had someone weave these materials into a luxurious feather coat. She could not see just how beautiful the coat was, but nonetheless enjoyed walking around the house while wearing it &mdash; it was meant to be seen by a person who no longer existed.

As the garb fluttered, she always felt that a bird-like soul was flying and passing through her hands and shoulders, ever-present.
