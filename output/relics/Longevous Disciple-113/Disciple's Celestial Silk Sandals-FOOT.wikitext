'''Disciple's Celestial Silk Sandals''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Longevous Disciple]].

==Description==
Whenever she detaches herself from the grasp of gravity and levitates to display celestial traces to the faithful, she can't help but think of an ancient legend from the Primeval Imperium &mdash;

"There once was a practitioner of immortal arts who had some success in their pursuit. They walked on the earth, employing the essence of its leylines to perform a myriad of miraculous techniques. The practitioner then attempted to take to the skies to be among the stars, but found that they had long since drifted away from the earth's leylines, and eventually fell into the abyss of death."

However, she believes the current situation is different. The Xianzhou had no roots. It was the Ambrosial Arbor that gave it a connection and a co-existence with the Aeon of Abundance, tying it tightly together with the immaculate pure land promised by Yaoshi. But now, the traitors have severed the connection to the way of immortality, making the Xianzhou once again a precarious island floating rootless in space.

The false earth on the Xianzhou cannot give her strength. The roots she seek are not under her feet, but in the bottomless chasm between stars. She will lead the disciples to give the Ambrosial Arbor a second life and embrace the supreme grace of Abundance.

Floating above thousands of people, clad in boots light as silk, she declares in a resounding voice, "When you look up at me, what you see is not me, but the celestial and elevated position that should have belonged to you."
