{{Description|An ingenium prosthetic limb made specifically for long-life species. Requires no invasive procedure to use.}}
'''Disciple's Ingenium Hand''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Longevous Disciple]].

==Description==
Applying protective gel to her underdeveloped arm stump, attaching the neural signal receivers tightly to her skin, and adjusting the tightness to firmly fix the ingenium wooden hand to her body &mdash; this has been her morning ablutions every morning for hundreds of years.

The wooden hand has brought her unwanted attention, but she neither wanted to invite trouble nor seek sympathy.

Despite possessing unrivaled talents and holding the reins of an entire Commission in her hands, the alienating attitude other showed towards her as a broken person never changed. Cowardly bullies eventually scattered to the winds, only to be replaced by flattering hypocrites with pretended pity who gathered like flies around her and gave fake praises to "the amazing blind and one-armed Incomplete One."

She has heard variations of this sentence thousands upon thousands of times in the past, and each time it made her wanting to puke. Now, as she faces these fawning faces begging for her mercy, she only feels disgust.

She unconsciously places her left hand onto the boiling cauldron. A sharp pain instantly shoots through her body. She quickly withdraws her hand, and see the blister in her palm healing rapidly.

"Sometimes, I feel the old wooden hand is more useful."
