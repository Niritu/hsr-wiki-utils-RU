{{Description|Encapsulated in the plane is the Herta Space Station. Parked above The Blue, it slowly drifts along its predetermined orbit, with the silent cosmos looking like a book waiting to be read.}}
'''Herta's Space Station''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Space Sealing Station]].

==Description==
Madam Herta was once very troubled by the huge collection of items spread across the Cosmos. Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself.

The generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research.

The IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research.

Most of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research.

However, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen.

Light from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull &mdash; for the stars were journeying with them.

Despite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way &mdash; The cosmos was a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection.
