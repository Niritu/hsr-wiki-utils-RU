{{Description|Madam Herta lost all interest in the space station the moment it was complete. The station maintains a steady orbital velocity as it circles The Blue, leaving a track of its circular motion on the planet below.}}
'''Herta's Wandering Trek''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Space Sealing Station]].

==Description==
The space station endured and survived many a crisis due to being owned by Madam Herta.

Laden with the rarest items in the entire universe like a feast set before ravenous guests, the space station was never free from threats or unwanted attention. Relying on the security personnel hired by the IPC and a somewhat advanced defensive system proved insufficient to handle the hostility from the stars... Madam Herta once made prescient judgment and steered the station away in an elegant curve, ending a conspiratorial attempt to assault the station before it even initiated.

As for her mastery in gathering intel to solve crises, she simply described it as "I spend time brewing coffee while others are reading books."

Rather than thieves who intend to steal its collection or mysterious factions with unknown objectives, the main threat faced by the space station remains its owner. The station could immediately fall into disaster if she ever had a wild idea. Curios that simulate a stellar collapse, a distorted gravitational field caused by the collision of dark galaxies... Madam Herta collected them all when she was in the mood, but would often lose interest once she got her hands on them.

Hence, though the space station appears to be floating peacefully in space, its treasure hoard of multi-shaped crises hung above it like a sword waiting to fall.

Senior researchers had long been aware of the dangers they faced, and understood that "secrets lie deep within danger." They strictly adhere to confidentiality agreements and faithfully carry out regulated containment procedures, thus burying danger within an outward silence... In the cafeteria, they were friends who could joke around. Yet, deep in the bowels of the space station's storage zones, they were highly skilled experts. In this place, secrets would always remain secrets.

The space station is operating as usual in low orbit around The Blue. Just like a pebble pushed out onto the smooth surface of a frozen lake, the station will continue to glide evenly and steadily in complete silence.
