'''Prisoner's Repressive Straitjacket''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Prisoner in Deep Confinement]].

==Description==
The borisin are warriors by nature. Their bone structure is broad and lean, with powerful jaws and neck muscles. They have well-developed canine teeth, beast-like ears on top of their heads, and sharp claws on their hands and feet. The borisin worship the concept of a strong body, seeing strong physique as a blessing from the gods.

The Warhead is both the spiritual leader and the strongest warrior of the tribe, commanding its tide-like army, and dominating life and death on the battlefield.

The fearsome beast ships setting off covered the very sky, and he looked down at the restless warriors on the battlefield &mdash; The borisin Warhead felt the call of Moon Rage. Sharp bone spikes pierced through his body, and his pitch-black blood disappeared in the wind like mist. He stretched out his arms like a martyr &mdash; the borisin's Lupitoxin, the fear-inducing pheromone, dispersed along with the blood mist and stimulated the borisin warriors' senses, making them seem possessed by the power of gods and demons.

"O' Brood Lord, grant us muscles of iron and bones of steel. O' Brood Lord, grant us the power of the gods."

He recalled the days when flesh and blood were not restrained. Children of the borisin, who carry Moon Rage in them, had broken through the limitations of flesh and blood. Their bodies erupted and deformed, yet no longer able to feel pain or fear. Guiding them was once a privilege and responsibility reserved only for the strong.
