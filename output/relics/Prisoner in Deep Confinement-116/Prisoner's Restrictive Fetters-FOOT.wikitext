'''Prisoner's Restrictive Fetters''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Prisoner in Deep Confinement]].

==Description==
The borisin roam the galaxy, despising the settled civilizations. They took away peace and tranquility and brought all-consuming war with them. Their harsh beliefs in survival compel them to fight incessantly, ever-devoting themselves to a life of bloodshed.

They have their own beliefs and ways &mdash; wherever the borisin set foot, it becomes their territory and nation.

The borisin Warhead takes pride from igniting one flame of war after another, crushing the dignity of protectors, drinking the tears of the displaced, and trampling on the trust of close ones. He allowed thorns to grow wild and fertile land to be destroyed, forced people into slavery and enjoyed an extravagant life... In order to surpass the past leaders, the new Warhead had to cast aside peace and lead his soldiers on an expedition to the outside world in order to make a name for himself and affirm his position in the tribe.

"Borisin Brood Lord, with you come war and a scourge upon all worlds. Your sentence is to be eternally detained and imprisoned, never to be reborn."

The Warhead is puzzled by the sentence. He looks around, confused at the trials of the weak. Those so-called crimes are nothing more than the laws of survival.
