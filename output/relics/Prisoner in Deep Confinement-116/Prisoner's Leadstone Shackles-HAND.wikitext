'''Prisoner's Leadstone Shackles''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Prisoner in Deep Confinement]].

==Description==
As the clouds parted, the moon's shadowy light poured over the Warhead's scarred body. The huge claw that was slashed off by the silver-haired swordsmaster was left aside, and the desperate Warhead's blood vessels pulsated furiously. Accompanied by a long, painful howl, he grew his sharp claw once more.

Catalyzed by Moon Rage, the Warhead barely caught up with the moonlight-like sword strikes. He prayed silently to the power of Abundance, determined to finish the final fight as a trapped beast.

He had already forgotten how many times the borisin army had broken through, only remembering the countless times his soldiers had used their claws to tear open the gaps in their advance, only for it to tightly close again. The exhausted borisin relied on their nigh indestructible regeneration, struggling to tear down all obstacles before them &mdash; The Warhead's blood soaked his claws and he sank into a trance, only to suddenly realize that he had nowhere to run, and there are no more soldiers following him.

"Borisin Brood Lord, you have taken countless lives by your own hand. Your wrists shall be bound in lead and stone and put under strict control."

The Warhead finally collapsed, powerless, in front of the swordsmaster. For the first time, he felt that exhausting near-death experience. "What an incomparable blade," he couldn't help but think, "What an incomparable thrill!"
