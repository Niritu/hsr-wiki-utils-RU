{{Description|A pair of leather gloves with partially cracked surfaces. The part where one holds a gun is particularly worn out.}}
'''Musketeer's Coarse Leather Gloves''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Musketeer of Wild Wheat]].

==Description==
Young Oakley practiced and practiced. She trained in the ranch from dawn to dusk. At times, her father felt surreptitiously surprised by and proud of little Oakley's talents, while other times he fretted over her future living the life of a musketeer.

Oakley's mother seemed to be the only one who actually cared and felt for young Oakley's tender little hands, often blaming Oakley's father for teaching her how to fire a gun.

From the time of that fateful duel to the time when she scored her first ever bounty earning much of her later fame, Oakley had used the same pair of worn gloves for years. Her peers didn't understand her insistence on wearing the same pair of broken gloves &mdash; Only she knew the conflicting emotions within those gloves, for they were the parting gifts her mother gave her.

What sort of emotional struggles must Oakley's mother have gone through, when she had been so stubbornly opposed to Oakley learning her way around guns?

After that duel, her mother wept unceasingly in Oakley's arms. Oakley didn't say anything, but her mother had already read Oakley's thoughts.
