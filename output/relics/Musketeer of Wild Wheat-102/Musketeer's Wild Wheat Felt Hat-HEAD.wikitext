{{Description|A cowboy hat decorated with wild wheat &mdash; a mark of the legendary Musketeer Oakley.}}
'''Musketeer's Wild Wheat Felt Hat''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Musketeer of Wild Wheat]].

==Description==
Oakley inherited this felt hat from her deceased father. Now that she tucked ears of wheat into the hat as ornaments, it looked much cuter than before. Bounty hunters, whether intentionally or not, always sought to craft emblems of their own, in the hope that these items could one day become the beginning of great legends.

The Interastral Peace Corporation offered bounties to enlist experts of the highest caliber to hunt down Interastral Pirates and Oakley, as one who always worked alone, forever sought out the most challenging regions of desolation among the farthest reaches of the world.

Days under the scorching hot sun were coupled with bitterly cold nights. In her lonely odyssey, Oakley could fall asleep with her head pillowed on her felt hat whenever she was near a bonfire. All her dreams were intruded by a mysterious gunslinger, who claimed to be a bounty hunter from afar. His scrawny figure was in sharp contrast with his fiercely stern gaze. The gunslinger challenged Oakley's father to a duel to the death at high noon. Shots were fired, a felt-hat was dropped, and Oakley's father was falling backwards to the ground, followed by the sounds of weeping and wailing from Oakley's mother...

Little Oakley gawked at the gunslinger in stupor, whose aptitude with a gun was so superb that her father could never stand a chance.

Waking up, there would be traces of damp tears on Oakley's felt hat. As a child, she learned how to shoot a gun only because she had wanted her father's handsome and stylish hat.
