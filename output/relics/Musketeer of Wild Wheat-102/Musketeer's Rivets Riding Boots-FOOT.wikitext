'''Musketeer's Rivets Riding Boots''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Musketeer of Wild Wheat]].

==Description==
The journey was long and arduous, but Oakley was long used to such loneliness. She was always wearing her riding boots to march to the farthest reaches of the world, regardless of how meager a pay she would get.

She had a hunch &mdash; that mysterious gunslinger must also be a man of seclusion. Their encounter would inevitably occur at a place frequented by few.

After coming by a harmonica, Oakley spent most of her alone time on intermittent practicing of songs. Her audience? No one but tarantulas, sandstorms, and tumbleweeds. Through her journey, Oakley was becoming better at coming up with techniques to kill time. It was said that wind had once stood and listened to Oakley's play on the harmonica, only leaving when the whole song came to an end. The IPC offered bounty hunters plenty of opportunities for interstellar traveling, and the destination was never a concern for this particular lone musketeer.

Sometimes Oakley did wonder if she was just chasing a phantom all this time, since that mysterious gunslinger was long gone without a trace. Sometimes it seemed that all Oakley ever did was to set out for one mission after another.

Oakley insisted, however, that as long as her fame as the Wild Wheat was far-reaching enough, the mysterious gunslinger would eventually show up at her door, just like how he once did at the ranch to duel her father.
