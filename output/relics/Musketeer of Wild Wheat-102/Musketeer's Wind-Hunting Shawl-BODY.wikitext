'''Musketeer's Wind-Hunting Shawl''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Musketeer of Wild Wheat]].

==Description==
A musketeer should never show their opening first when dueling. Oakley could discreetly load bullets into the chamber and lock onto the mark without alarming her targets. For any onlookers, her loose-fitting cloak never moved one inch until the shot was fired. No one could figure out how she did it.

"Intricate moves should be done under the cover of the cloak. The duel must be over before the bullet had left the gun." Her father repeatedly emphasized.

After accidentally encountering a group of armed bandits, Oakley calmly steadied herself and observed the situation. Before pulling out her gun, she had remained upright like a mountain rock that had not been moved in centuries. She finished all her preparations before the bandits could even move a finger. After a round of clear-sounding shots, Oakley intentionally let go of one bandit to send out a warning to the whole cohort.

Thoughtless, expressionless, often leaving her opponents with no hope of ever defeating her &mdash; that was how her fellow bounty hunters viewed Oakley.

While dueling, Oakley was more like that one mysterious intruding gunslinger in her dreams, with her brisk and clean shots and not a single superfluous move. She couldn't help but resent her own self when she realized that she was becoming more and more like her nemesis.
