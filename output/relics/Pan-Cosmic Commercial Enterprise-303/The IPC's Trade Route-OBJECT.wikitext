{{Description|With the convenient help of the credit system, interstellar commerce was established. The Interastral Peace Corporation connected the stars with economic activity and expanded the borders of trade.}}
'''The IPC's Trade Route''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Pan-Cosmic Commercial Enterprise]].

==Description==
The support team hurried around the star system close to the Aeon Qlipoth, with the old ships' trajectories forming the first routes.

Believing in the meaningfulness of the Aeon's actions, the support team took the first step in exchanging goods for other goods with a neighboring star system. The support team prepared an adequate fleet, rare and precious goods, and offers that were hard to refuse, thus creating countless trades across star systems. Then, the support team controlled trade route and business information, held exclusive bargaining rights, and spearheaded the formulation of the cosmos's trade regulations.

Fleets full of wood, stone, rebar, and supernium passed by Aeon Qlipoth like a swarm of circling flies. The Amber Lord kept silent, never once casting THEIR gaze upon the humans.

Eventually, times changed and trade with neighboring star systems was no longer sufficient for the bustling support team. The two wise ones were determined to delve deeper into the cosmos, and thus the Interastral Peace Corporation was born. The IPC offered anything a planet could ever want, at fair prices pegged to their "credits." Since then, the cosmos's trade route was founded, and all planets that join the IPC's business network can share the same currency, buy the same goods, and enjoy the same services.

Merchant ships under the credit system travel between the stars, and the trade routes merge and separate to weave a pan-cosmic network. The ships full of treasures from distant stars passed the Aeon Qlipoth countless times like fireflies, and yet the Aeon remained as silent as before.

The building materials accumulated since the time of the support team piled up on every planet around the Aeon Qlipoth, and the amount will only increase. The Aeon Qlipoth has no intention of accepting these eager gifts, instead always solely focused on the crisis that will befall the unsuspecting mortals, having to cast the gargantuan barriers measured in light-years. The small organization that used to purchase materials has long since become a tremendous influence in the cosmos. They gaze upon the headless colossus, never once feeling that their efforts were in vain.

"All the toil and growth of our capital is for Qlipoth, and to execute the Aeon's will when the time comes."
