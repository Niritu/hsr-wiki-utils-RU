{{Description|The IPC's headquarters at Pier Point is sealed within a Planar Sphere. No planet can hide from the grand business plan of the Interastral Peace Corporation. They ventured into deep space to harvest the power of the entire universe.}}
'''The IPC's Mega HQ''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Pan-Cosmic Commercial Enterprise]].

==Description==
The impact within the subspace shook the universe as the silent and lonely colossus committed to building the great barrier across the Cosmos. Those who claimed to have received the oracle of the god began to act, wishing to help the Aeon Qlipoth to build the wall.

The universe is in imminent peril, and the building of the wall cannot wait. The puny humans had no intention of imitating the feats of the god, instead gathering into a self-proclaimed "support team" for the Aeon, willing to devote everything to the Amber Lord. With the power of Preservation, the support team piloted their fleet to different stellar systems to purchase building materials such as stone, wood, gold, and supernium, then tirelessly transported these to the subspace barrier, piling the items on the planetary wasteland.

After the end of the short development period, the support team took a firm foothold in Pier Point and established the Interastral Peace Corporation. In order to fully carry out their devotion, they turned their sights to deep space.

Louis Fleming raised a call for action, and the long-distance trade fleet left the star systems adjacent to Aeon Qlipoth. Their commodities were no longer limited to building materials... They plan to connect the whole Cosmos and trade everything. Soon after, Dongfang Qixing implemented Cosmos-wide trade regulations and built a "credit" system to set a price for everything across the universe. Trillions of assets gathered under their megastructure on Pier Point. Like a silent black hole, the building destroyed people's notions about the limits of wealth.

Today, the ships of the Interastral Peace Corporation are all over the Cosmos. Despite being criticized as a corporate dictatorship, the IPC has not stopped expanding. They don't care what other people think and have never forgotten their founding mission.

The IPC's recruit training methods change with each passing day, but after nearly eight hundred Amber Eras, there is only one historical practice that never changed. Once upon a time, Louis Fleming, the founder of the IPC, stood in front of the support team and made a passionate speech. He put forward the aspiration of uniting the universe and supporting the Aeon's wishes to protect the universe. As soon as the speech ended, the distant and huge sound of a cosmic impact sounded, injecting a lofty calling into this solemn and sublime moment. From that moment on, they knew this would become their unswerving belief.

"All for the Amber Lord."
