'''Lushaka's Twinlanes''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Lushaka, the Sunken Seas]].

==Description==
To the aqua sprites, the world above the water was originally unfamiliar and perilous, but that is now no more than a distant memory. After all, things that were once above the water have long been submerged in this deep blue.

The land-dwellers of Lushaka have an intimate yet unfamiliar relationship with the aqua sprites. In deepsea investigations, the land-dwellers view encounters with the aqua sprites as lucky omens, describing the spirits as beautiful and mysterious creatures. Aqua sprites possess navy blue wing membranes and onyx eyes, as well as unique vocal cords capable of producing ethereal sounds. According to stories passed down by mouth among the deepsea investigators, these creatures often accompany sea dragons and reside in a silvery city deep underwater &mdash; they exist between reality and legend, embodying serenity and liveliness.

However, the language used to describe them in the ocean-drowned past was &mdash; Edars, monsters of the deep sea.

Long ago, the Edars and the land-dwellers fiercely vied for survival. No one could ignore the vivid red the oceans were dyed into. Initially, juvenile Edars were regarded as mere fishing catches. Then, the land-dwellers were lured into the ocean to drown by the songs of the Edars. Both races were hunters and prey for the other in the vast waters. Then came clashes between blades and anchors, as well as battles between sea beasts and cannons. The relentless war, both above and below the water's surface, persisted until the reefs shattered under scorching magma. It was only after a long time that stateship scholars understood that the Cancer of All Worlds has long promised Lushaka's future &mdash; only that the promises came from an aqua sprite who lost her home, who cursed the culprit in the nightmare with a silent scream.

The long-forgotten past lies entombed within the steel and concrete coral reefs of the deep sea, as ephemeral as smoke and clouds, known to none.

Since then, cities and lands have been swallowed by the sea, disputes and blood have been consumed by the ocean, and history and civilization engulfed by the waves. To escape rising deep-water pressure, the aqua sprites constantly migrate upward, compelled to dwell in cities once home to land-dwellers, prying into memories filled with smiles and tears... They know that few sounds remain on the surface, and the azure now belongs to them alone. Yet, the silence is too overwhelming.

When the stateship's songsters glimpse azurean silken wings along their nautical course, they will start to sing that beautiful medley...

"They journey along the course, in pursuit of the light tower and storm, seeking only to reclaim that pure blue."
