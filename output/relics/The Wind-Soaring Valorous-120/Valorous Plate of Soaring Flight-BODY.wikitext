{{Description|Like the cold wind, soaring above a pack of wolves with their heads held high. The hunter and the hunted will eventually switch places.}}
'''Valorous Plate of Soaring Flight''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[The Wind-Soaring Valorous]].

==Description==
She still remembered the ancient ballad of the fox clans, singing a tune that never quite became a melody, only a mournful lament for their lost homeland. ''"Sauntering fox on the distant shore. Traveling slowly, thirsty and hungry. My heart is filled with sorrow, yet no one knows my grief."''...

Thousands of years ago, they became livestock, servants, and currency under the tyranny of the wolves' claws. Thousands of years later, they still fight tirelessly for the liberation of their kin. Despite lacking their natural enemies' constant mutating and transforming bodies, they possess keen adaptability and wit.

Their wolf-headed masters commanded them to craft tools for use, yet repeatedly dug out their eyes to prevent learning and forbade them from possessing metals to avoid copying any tools. None of this could erase the fox clans' inner desire: One day, they would teach the hunters the fear of being hunted. One day, they would swap places with the hunters and pursue those without rest.

In the end, the fox races forged porcelain into armor. The Verdantia Knights' porcelain armor was as light as the wind and strong as steel. Their wolf-headed masters' claws and weapons of flesh could not harm them in the slightest.

The general donned this porcelain armor, rising with the Verdantia Fleet warriors with the wind, becoming a nightmare soaring above the borisin. They advanced and retreated in formation, like a flock of hunting birds, echoing each other. But no matter how sturdy this armor was, she always believed in this: A body tempered by pain is the best weapon, and comrades who share hardship are the best armor.

''"Birds spread wings. Beasts bare fangs. Who said we have naught to garner? Our comrades are our armor."''
