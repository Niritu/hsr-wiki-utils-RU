'''Valorous Greaves of Pursuing Hunt''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[The Wind-Soaring Valorous]].

==Description==
She watched the girl's figure dart swift and sure in the soft moonlight. She followed the girl's footsteps and scent like a hunter tracking their prey. Finally, she waited for the girl at the end of the road.<br />Or perhaps, it was the girl waiting for her to arrive.

In the moonlight, the general saw that face clearly.<br />''"Do you want to join the Cloud Knights that much?"''<br />''"I don't want to give my life to a wolf-headed master."''<br />The girl's borisin speech was difficult and broken. The expression on that face &mdash; the general had seen it countless times while rescuing trapped kin from the fallen territories.<br />Though these people shared the same blood as her, yet they spoke different languages and harbored different thoughts.<br />They never considered themselves descendants of the foxes, but then, who were they?<br />The general trembled slightly, stepping aside and vacating the path.<br />''"Go. From tonight, they won't chase you anymore..."''<br />''"But I want them dead."''

The general looked at her in disbelief, as amazed as if she had seen a shooting star streak across the sky, and the girl's animal-like figure suddenly vanished into the darkness.<br />The general closed her eyes as if the moonlight burned them. After a moment, she looked down and saw the girl's bare, thorn-scarred feet covered in mud.

''"Why aren't you wearing shoes?"''<br />''"I forgot. I didn't notice."''<br />The general took off her own boots, compared sizes, and helped the girl put them on.<br />''"They fit pretty well... Let's go then."''<br />''"What about you?"''<br />''"I'm used to walking on thorns."''

She quickened her pace, barefoot and agile, with the girl closely chasing after her.<br />Or perhaps, they were both chasing after each other.
