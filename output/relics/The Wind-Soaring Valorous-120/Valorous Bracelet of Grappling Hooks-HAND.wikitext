{{Description|A bionic gauntlet integrated with the body. To hunt fearsome beasts, one must possess claws sharper than those of the beasts themselves.}}
'''Valorous Bracelet of Grappling Hooks''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[The Wind-Soaring Valorous]].

==Description==
The Verdant Knights under her command were as valiant as the Borisin Wolftroopers. Even if their swords broke and their bows snapped, without an inch of iron left in their hands, they could still fight to the death relying solely on the sharp claws on their gauntlets.

It is rumored that the foxian warriors of the Verdantia Fleet often rescued worlds ruled by the borisin. These foxians born in "fallen territories" have mixed bloodlines, occasionally producing individuals exhibiting atavistic mutations. These foxian individuals are conscripted as war slaves, driven by their wolf-headed masters to serve as vanguards before battles and as cannon fodder to delay attacks by Xianzhou ships.

"Join the Verdant Knights, and we will give you the chance to seek revenge against your wolf-headed masters!" During recruitment and training, the general remembered saying this to the young foxian girl. But she felt guilty for the latter half of the sentence that she couldn't bring herself to say: "Like me, you were born for war and will die for war."

Although the war slaves possessed strength and speed comparable to their wolf-headed masters, their mutations also depleted their life and sanity. When their will was burnt to embers by rage, they would descend into bloodthirsty monsters.

When pure bestial fury rules their bodies and after completing the final hunt and chase of this life, these gauntlets will become shackles that bind their hands, never to be separated from flesh and blood again.
