{{Description|A face mask modeled after the ferocious bird "Dafeng." With its two pairs of auxiliary eyes, it has witnessed divine miracles.}}
'''Valorous Mask of Northern Skies''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[The Wind-Soaring Valorous]].

==Description==
Her eagle helmet had two pairs of auxiliary eyes, ensuring clear vision of her surroundings under any lighting conditions. However, these auxiliary eyes were now coated with dried, tainted blood, and everything within sight was tinged with rust.

The general awoke from unconsciousness, rising from a mountain of corpses. Behind her, the Cloudpeer Telescope stood tall like a towering spire reaching into the sky. At the pinnacle of the tower, a radiant light pulsed incessantly, repeating cryptic messages that only stargazers could decipher. Sustained by the collective will of trillions within the Alliance, it was praying to the god &mdash; right now, she and her lifeless comrades who had long since laid down their lives were fighting for this whispered plea to reach the heavens and bestow death.

"It's here..." the general murmured softly, gazing upward. She couldn't see the form of the god or hear THEIR voice, but she could sense the evidence of THEIR arrival &mdash; waves of scorching air suddenly surged, like a branding iron skimming across her skin. Fiery sparks danced amidst the mist of blood, obscuring the sky like a curtain, which, in the ensuing moment, was torn open by an unbearable light...

It came. The miracle exchanged through the lives of countless soldiers finally came. She had witnessed the ruins of celestial bodies condemned by the god to become realms of the dead and had once pursued this light's trail in battle. She thought the light was extremely fast, too fast to even entertain any stray thoughts. But she was wrong. That moment was long enough for her to think of her beloved disciple again:

''"Make a wish, then. Wish for her path to be clear..."''

The earth surged like angry waves, roaring with the sea of light, and she had no more worldly thoughts, transforming into dust within the light.
