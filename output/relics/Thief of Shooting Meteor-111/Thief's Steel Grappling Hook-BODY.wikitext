'''Thief's Steel Grappling Hook''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Thief of Shooting Meteor]].

==Description==
A well-prepared thief can always escape safely from desperate situations with a life-saving grappling hook equipped under his belt at all times.

"How to throw the grappling hook at the right target... Could you explain how you made all those moves?"

The secret treasure storage room was full of lethal mechanisms, but the thief danced around them using the grappling hook at his waist as if he were performing a waltz in mid-air. In a split second from when he reached for his belt, Leblanc threw the grappling hook to a wall tens of meters high, and the pulley then rolled and instantly sent the thief to the "Star of Leo."

To come and go anywhere one so desires, with just the steel grappling hook equipped under one's belt, is the basic qualification required of a professional thief.

"You know, we could just let the stunt double play his part in the sequel. That'll save us a lot of money," the action choreographer quipped. "The audience wouldn't know who was under the mask anyway."
