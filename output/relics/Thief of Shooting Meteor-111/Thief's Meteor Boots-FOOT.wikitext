'''Thief's Meteor Boots''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Thief of Shooting Meteor]].

==Description==
Leblanc would deliberately leave a beam of dazzling light behind him when jumping from roof to roof, earning him the title of the "Meteor Thief."

"How would one escape if there were no skyscrapers? Hahahaha, spare me these ignorant questions."

He had sneaked away from countless chases, and it made him a master of escape. No one could catch up with his Meteor Boots in the city unless someone knew where his base of operations was. To Leblanc's surprise, a detective with messy hair was sitting inside with his coffee cup, having waited for Leblanc for a long time.

The story of the thief is over. Now is the time for the legend of the detective.

"Many people don't believe we would write like this, which is exactly why we do so." An anonymous writer explained the controversial end of the Meteor Thief.
