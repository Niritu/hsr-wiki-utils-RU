'''Thief's Gloves With Prints''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Thief of Shooting Meteor]].

==Description==
Meteor Thief Leblanc was never a neat freak. He didn't care about leaving traces. He would always leave misleading clues, serving the right amount of provocation.

"How could these people in the IPC have been fooled so many times? Perhaps the fault should lie with the IPC, not me."

His gloves could generate all sorts of prints, which always made a fool of the IPC's fingerprint detection devices, leaving them with a bunch of harmless so-called "thief's flaws." The security team found hundreds of prints in their secret treasure storage room, including those of prehistoric pterosaurs, interstellar ladybugs, labradors... Needless to say, none of them belonged to the thief.

Vanishing without a trace was tedious and served only to group one alongside those timid little thieves who've got absolutely no style.

"Fiction should never outright contradict reality. Who still uses fingerprint systems these days?" The IPC's security team complained. "Do these writers have any common sense at all?"
