'''Thief's Myriad-Faced Mask''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Thief of Shooting Meteor]].

==Description==
Meteor Thief Leblanc saw heists as participating in a masquerade ball, and hiding his identity was part of the etiquette.

"How could a mask change a person's height and voice? Hahaha, it's a patented secret. Completely confidential."

Wearing a mask, Leblanc disguised himself as an ordinary staff member, sneaked into the IPC's security meeting, and offered advice on their "thief prevention measures." It was not until half a month after the theft that the security team recalled that they didn't know that "colleague" at the meeting.

Thieves had to lead a double life, requiring various means of disguise. Such was the tradition of the world of thievery.

"Can your writers make the thief wear the mask throughout the film?" The marketing team of the IPC's Radio, Film, and Television Department said to the producer. "I am once again stressing the need for this mask as merchandise. Affordability and popularity are equally important."
