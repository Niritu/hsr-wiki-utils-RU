'''Pioneer's Starfaring Anchor''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters]].

==Description==
"O, you who turn the wheel and watch the wind,<br />Think of Frebass,<br />And how she was once as beautiful and stood as tall as you."

The lead boots, like iron anchors, drag the girl down further and further. They are dutifully carrying out the task bestowed upon them from the beginning of their conception.

The girl never closes her eyes, fighting boldly against the cold and lonely darkness. She remembers the first time she heard stories about Akivili. She remembers the first day she set upon the journey and the "Medallion of Honor" she forged for herself. She remembers the 30 days she spent journeying with her companion. She remembers the forest glade they gathered in for the first and last time, and how the air there tasted like raspberries. She remembers whistles, guitars, and the flute, and the songs they sang together. She remembers scarlet snow falling on slightly burnt marshmallows and disappearing.

The vast void looms near the end of the vivid memories, yet she suddenly sees a dash of crimson blinking briefly into existence in the center of the pitch-black world.

Therefore, the little Nameless remembers the smile she gave from the bottom of her heart when the girl with the sword took the marshmallows for the final time.

"I never thought I would meet anyone similar to me. You've walked so much further on this road than me.<br />Therefore, you will surely walk with me till then end, right?"<br />"Of course. Our end has already been determined... However, just like you said &mdash;<br />Even though I may turn into a shallow puddle of dead water in the end, there is still a lot I can do on my journey toward that moment. Therefore, no matter what, I have to go try it&mdash;<br />&mdash; Because I will walk on a road deeper and further than Akivili's!"
