{{Description|A heavy diving helmet in a style common in Orkron. Through the small porthole, one can only see the unbearable and endless expanse of darkness.}}
'''Pioneer's Heatproof Shell''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters]].

==Description==
Clouds accumulate over Orkron's night sky, and shimmering planetary rings are concealed within them. Scarlet snowflakes fall on the heavy helmet, quietly filling the grooves of rusted iron, covering the traces of erosion. The two girls sit in the cedarwood forest... taking a momentary break in their journey.

"Look! The air in Orkron smells like raspberries." Scarlet snowflakes fall on the soft, cloud-like sugar threads and quickly disappear. The little Nameless from Toyro laughs and then bends over, holding her stomach. She laughs at her own choice of words &mdash; how can one see a scent with one's eyes? After a moment of shared laughter, the silence cuts like a sharpened blade, and the air seems to frost over in an instant.

"Frebass, are you still going to the depths of IX?" The question comes from her companion who is always carrying a long blade. She is a good companion, but no one knows where she comes from.

The little Nameless hides inside her bulky diving suit. A long pause later, she hands the companion a slightly burnt marshmallow, her eyes narrowed like the silhouette of a fully opened sail:

"Of course &mdash; because I will walk on a road deeper and further than Akivili's!"
