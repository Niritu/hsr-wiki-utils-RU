{{Description|A heavy diving suit crafted from scrap iron, airtight and impenetrable. Even its wearer often jests that it resembles more of a deep-sea coffin.}}
'''Pioneer's Sealed Lead Apron''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters]].

==Description==
"Frebass, the Nameless from Toyro, died for fourteen days and nights.<br />She forgot the cries of seagulls, the roar of the abyss,<br />The gains, and the losses."

The little Nameless gazed at the planetary ring wider than the boulevards of Toyro. She decided to launch herself into the singularity in the black hole.

"Even Akivili didn't manage to go there." The girl could always hear the distant sound of waves echoing in her heart. "I will walk on a road deeper and further than Akivili's." She prepared herself thoroughly &mdash; unidentified rusty metal plates, used oxygen tanks, discarded gyroscopic posture control devices, a self-circulating life support system, and a rectifying hood... She soldered all the materials together, ensuring that the entire suit was airtight. She believed it would protect her from the harm of Nihility.

She picked up the diving helmet her father left behind and wore a self-made "Medallion of Honor." Before leaving, she and her companion once again went to the cedarwood forest, toasting marshmallows one last time.

Later, when Frebass' spacecraft approached the edge of the black hole, this was all she could recall about Orkron.
