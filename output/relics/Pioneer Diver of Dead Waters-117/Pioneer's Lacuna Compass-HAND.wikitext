{{Description|A compass in the form of a wristwatch. The magnetic needle has been removed and can no longer point in any direction.}}
'''Pioneer's Lacuna Compass''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters]].

==Description==
"The undercurrent in the sea,<br />Whispering as it pecked at her bones, in one rise and fall of time,<br />She experienced the stages of old age and youth,<br />And entered the vortex."

The girl has heard a story like this. In the story, the world people inhabit is depicted as a towering tree, composed of ownerless energy. "This kind of energy is invisible, intangible, incomprehensible, and meaningless," she thought, "just like how IX has no meaning."

The little Nameless is somewhat melancholic, worrying about how she would orient herself after stepping into the depths of "Nihility." But soon, she had an inspiration &mdash; on her fourteenth birthday, her mother left her with one last gift... a small compass.

"If that's the case, as long as the compass senses not the magnetic field but 'energy,' wouldn't that solve the problem?"

The little Nameless removed the magnetic needle from the compass, but when the girl descended into the darkness, she realized that the compass' only direction was down.
