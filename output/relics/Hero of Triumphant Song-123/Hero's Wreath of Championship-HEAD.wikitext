'''Hero's Wreath of Championship''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Hero of Triumphant Song]].

==Description==
Time appears to slow with Oronyx's sighs. He can hear his own weighted breathing, his ribs throbbing with pain in his chest, as if trying to suck in all the air in the arena... Sweat and blood mix together, the earth beneath his feet seducing him into surrender, to enjoy that soft, soothing rest &mdash; He is absolutely spent.

"Where will the next blow come from? Left, or right? A feint? Or..."

The speartip is already lunging towards him, leaving him no time to think. Might as well entrust his fate to the Strife Titan &mdash; all he needs to do is thrust his spear forth.

The dust gradually settles, slanted rays of sunlight shining over the coliseum's side, bathing the flank of his face. He sees the spectators starting to stand up from their seats, raucous applause and cheers riding through the air like a surging tide. At this moment, to his surprise, he discovers that the coliseum is extremely spacious, and the feeling of being unable to escape seems to have never existed. The center of the vast coliseum contains only blood streaks, the fallen opponent, and a solitary, shining victor.

The lord of the city raises his hand high, declaring him the champion. The booming of drums follows and he dons the wreath, becoming a legend of the coliseum.

"You have been chosen as the barrier troops commander attending to the lord of the city. Your name will be synonymous with victory, to be written in heroic epics!"

Soon after, his name is cheered by all across the city. Nikador's glory shrouds him as if the entire world exists only for him.
