'''Hero's Gilded Bracers''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Hero of Triumphant Song]].

==Description==
Be it a triumphant victory or total defeat, the coliseum champion is always able to return from the battlefield. The lord of the city attributes his fortuitous luck as a "symbol of victory," thus robbing the lance and shield in his hands in exchange for trumpets and banners, ordering him to bequeath his good fortune unto the whole army. The soldiers firmly believe that Nikador's glory walks with him, and as long as he spearheads the front, the path to victory is all but assured.

"Henceforth, you are no longer needed as a warrior, but should become a symbol."

The body honed sturdy as rock over days and nights of strenuous training, now exists only to be admired like a temple statue.

He has been barred from the training grounds, for the soldiers mortally fear the slightest accident befalling this "symbol of victory." He has been invited to the lord of the city's feast, where guests insist he regale them with the legendary tale of those sixteen fights to the death. Now, he has been stationed at the borders of the battlefield, holding a trumpet, his scintillating gold braces reflecting a profile growing ever more unfamiliar, and a sudden tightness grips his heart &mdash; he only has to blow on this trumpet, never needing to charge into the fray again... So, this is the "A hero who wins without fighting" of which people speak.

"...If this can bring victory to the army, I will voluntarily forsake my glory on the battlefield."

Nikador never chooses a path to victory for a "symbol," so he dares not slack off &mdash; the final battle of his life may be upon him...
