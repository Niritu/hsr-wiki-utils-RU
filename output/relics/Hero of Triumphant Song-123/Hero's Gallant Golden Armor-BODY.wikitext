'''Hero's Gallant Golden Armor''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Hero of Triumphant Song]].

==Description==
When confronting the god, whose mind has long been steeped in madness, it is destined that no mortal will leave the battle a victor. Spears break and shields fly where Nikador's lance sweeps past, wreaking destruction across every inch of the frontline... Disorder spreads throughout the ranks, soldiers descending into unprecedented chaos and fear. Drowned out by screams, wails, and the clanging clash of steel weapons, the trumpet calls of the coliseum hero have long since been unable to turn the tides of this defeat.

"Nikador wishes to take back the victory they promised, and I must repay it with my lance and blood."

In the roiling smoke and dust, a tattered banner advances in Nikador's direction. The soldiers notice that the hero of fortuitous fortune has chosen not to return home.

In the beginning, only four or five soldiers followed the hero. Then it turned into dozens, then hundreds... They walk behind the broad figure toward a battlefield of inevitable death to initiate their final charge &mdash; their fallen comrades seemingly turned into heroic spirits, whispering into their ears, spurring the survivors into finishing this final gambit. Even if Nikador has already descended into madness, they must have instinctively felt the resolute determination and undaunted will of this band of warriors.

"Look! The hero of the coliseum is still pushing forward! We must follow with haste!"

His gilded armor still glints in the hues of sunset's glow, as he leads the army towards a dignified and noble death.
