'''Hero's Firechasing Shinguard''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Hero of Triumphant Song]].

==Description==
The soldiers mutely walk into the ruins and start to sweep the battlefield. Some drag the corpses apart with difficulty, separating friend from foe, while others kneel by their dead comrades and gently close the eyes of the deceased... The battlefield's roars have long dissipated, leaving only a suffocating silence &mdash; The hero of the coliseum also sleeps forever among these fallen, only leaving behind a pair of upright gilded shinguards among the blood and dust.

"Remember, warriors on the battlefield never truly disappear. Their heroic souls will forever stay in the memories of future generations."

Later, the silence is shattered by wailing elegies. Priests shuffle into the battlefield to organize funerals for the dead.

Fires light up the dark night, and the dirges endure for a time unceasing... Suddenly, the distant sky is pierced by a splendid ray of light, as if the Lance of Fury has been thrust into the earth &mdash; it is Nikador's summon to the heroic souls of this place. With that, the attending soldiers and commonfolk all kneel, raising both their hands above their heads, their hearts brimming with respect and gratitude &mdash; That ray of light turns into a warm aura of embrace, gently lifting each warrior's soul while whispering of the Titan's graces and magnanimity, proclaiming the heroes' everlasting immortality.

"Look, the hero of the coliseum leads the soldiers on a homeward triumph even in death."

The hero nods faintly &mdash; in the ballads of old, his noble soul will once again be reforged.
