{{Description|He often sits in the confessional booth listening to the stories. The earrings serve as a constant reminder that even the faintest whispers have their weight.}}
'''Sacerdos' Melodic Earrings''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Sacerdos' Relived Ordeal]].

==Description==
"As you command. I committed sins. I falsely claimed that various lineages were divided and exchanged this hearsay misinformation for payment..."

Through the partition, the family head catches the journalist's evasive gaze as the penitent nervously awaits his response &mdash; a ritual of confession he had done countless times when his consolations ring out like bells to let the faithful repent for their sins. However, this time he subconsciously turns his head, trying to say something but stopping himself, letting his metal earrings emit a crisp noise next to his ears.

"I'm fully aware that this claim is completely groundless. Thanks to the grace of the Great One, all Family members stand united as one. This is the collective desire of all lineage members, and their reason for devoutly embracing the Great One."

The penitent confesses his sins, resolves to amend his mistakes, and seeks absolution from their evil via the harmonic tunes. The family head closes his eyes gently and utters the sacred benediction.

"Very well. Show your sincerity to the other Family members and dispel those rumors. In this way, you shall be reinstated with harmony. Now, please leave in peace."

What sin is there in speaking truth? His dictates are crystal clear but are burdened like a yoke. He sighs and shakes his head.

"...Next, please step forward."
