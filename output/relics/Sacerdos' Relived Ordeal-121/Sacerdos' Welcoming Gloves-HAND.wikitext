{{Description|He often stands in the mansion to greet visitors, countless times making the gesture of invitation. The pristine gloves remind him of observances of humility and courtesy.}}
'''Sacerdos' Welcoming Gloves''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Sacerdos' Relived Ordeal]].

==Description==
"These visitors claimed to have urgent matters to report, esteemed head, but some of their identities remain questionable, and they used shady means to enter the Dreamscape..."

The uninvited guests trespassing the Dreamscape are lined up. If all goes according to plan, malefactors who inflicted harm will face banishment, and impostors with fraudulent identities will be apprehended. He says nothing, yet all arrangements have been made. The innocents witness his wrath, and expectations and uneasy spark in their eyes &mdash; Then, he smiles, extending his hand in an inviting gesture to the people remaining before him. It is a symbol of acknowledgment and a display of authority.

"You are all esteemed guests of the Oak Family, and therefore you shall be welcomed with courtesy. Perhaps you wonder how you are judged fairly. Allow me to give a short explanation &mdash; It is because the 'road' you walk on has crossed with mine."

The attendants, the artists, and the jobless ones dispelled their doubts as they recognized the truth behind his invitation.

"Let transgressors face deserved punishment, and let guests receive deserved courtesy. Such should be the law of harmony."

The family head's combined sternness and generosity are enough to earn him the trust of his guests. Surveying the assembly, he bows slowly...

"Welcome to the Oak family."
