'''Sacerdos' Ceremonial Garb''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Sacerdos' Relived Ordeal]].

==Description==
"...Birds are born with no shackles, then what fetters my fate♬?"

On rehearsal day, the young family head hides in a corner of the audience seats, refraining from distracting the singer on the stage and maintaining the right distance, just as he had wished. He sits upright in his ceremonial garb as the solitary listener for that moment. Amidst the familiar melodies, his thoughts drift back to his childhood, recalling occasions when she sang on stage, and he was her only audience &mdash;

"It's been so long since you sang with joy... I've built a stage for you, though it's... a bit rudimentary."

During the concert for the two of them, he vowed to fulfill her dream of gracing a grander, brighter stage someday.

"Let my heart bravely spread the wings. Soaring past the night. To trace the bright moonlight...♬"

He snaps out of his trance, then faces the root of his reluctance to draw nearer to the stage &mdash; His ceremonial garb is not just for enjoying the performance, but for the chance to withdraw at any moment he pleased.

"Congratulations, sister. We have both achieved our aspirations," he softly utters.
