{{Description|Animal bones, arrowheads, and caltrops bind the world of the Aidonians with that of the dead. The ascetics of the wastelands only hoped that their souls, unyielding, could pass through the frozen depths, and would not become lost from poverty or weakness on the way to seeing their god.}}
'''Aidonia's Deathward Bone Chains''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Bone Collection's Serene Demesne]].

==Description==
Once, an aggressive fool questioned the believers in Aidonia, unbelieving as to how there could be a religion in Amphoreus that reveres death. "If you love {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}} so much, why not just pierce your own chest with a spear?"

The Aidonians regarded the man with disdain, saying, "The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren."

Since its founding, Aidonia has been a holy site that valued life the most out of all Amphoreus. The followers of {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}} believe that the River of Souls' waters are cold enough to chill the bones &mdash; only those who have walked the earth long enough and have endured countless hardships can cross its icy abyss and face {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}}. To seek the blessing of Death is not to disregard life.

For this reason, though the Aidonians considered death as a homecoming and gave birth to many fearsome warriors, they have never sought to conquer the fertile lands to the south &mdash; For those lands do not forge strong souls, and the Aidonians disdain the softness of comfort.

Asceticism is a unique cultural hallmark of the Aidonians. Every year, when the snow subsides and the rare days of clear skies appear, they celebrate the Bone Collection Festival. Priests of Aidonia leave the city in search of animal bones buried in the wastelands and swamps. The most sacred offerings come from the remains of prehistoric beasts, long dead since many Light Calendar years ago. When their bones are struck, a deep echo seems to carry the faint whisper of {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}}. The animal bones, cold as if soaked in the freezing ice of the River of Souls, are transported back to the city one by one. The slightly broken ones get processed and become ornaments, to be worn by the people day and night. The best-preserved bones, on the other hand, are carefully polished by the priests into ceremonial bone swords for burials, offered as gifts during the festival.

One year, during the Bone Collection Festival, the Aidonians encountered that girl in the wasteland. Soon, rumors spread that "her touch could allow one to cross the barrier of the River of Souls and directly face death."

Devotees of Death flocked to the temple to meet the emissary of {RUBY_E#Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The Aidonian priests, sensing that the girl threatened their faith, consecrated her as the Maiden of War, forbidding commoners from approaching her. Only those ascetics who had endured the trials of the world and revered both life and death were allowed to be embraced by her, and through her hand return their souls to the afterlife. The girl donned the long robes prepared by the priests, executed her ritual with her bare hands, and buried humankind with her embrace.

The Aidonians genuinely believe that "The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren." Yet, the River of Souls does not question the weight of the soul. It simply flows, leading all life to its inevitable end, where all souls converge.
