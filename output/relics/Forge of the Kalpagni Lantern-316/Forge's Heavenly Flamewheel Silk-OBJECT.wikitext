{{Description|The heliobus progenitor, as grand in scope and size as a star, drowns in an endless dream. As it slumbers, the atoms and molecules around its body clash and spark, endlessly permeating outward from the external shell crafted from the Flamewheel, ultimately appearing as iridescent light bands resembling strands of celestial silk.}}
'''Forge's Heavenly Flamewheel Silk''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Forge of the Kalpagni Lantern]].

==Description==
The Xianzhou Zhuming has always been accompanied by multicolored light bands while voyaging in deep space. These bands are both energy outputs from super-high-temperature fusion reactions, as well as evidence that the Flint Emperor still burns and shall never die.

On the outermost skirts of the aurora-inducing particles dispersed with the Flint Emperor's breaths, newborn heliobi slow down and wander into being. The Flamehunt Judges of the Zhuming Ten-Lords Commission then capture these naive heliobi that have not had any contact with emotions, using kind and gentle dreams to tame the immature temperaments of such flames. Then, the judges pass these harmless heliobi to the Artisanship Commission's Temperaflame Office, which matches the heliobi with various artifacts to make them into lamps, vehicles, and various spectacles in Zhuming... However, in the eyes of confused outworlders, these talking and walking items are proof of the rumor that "divine essence exists everywhere in the delves, and items would become demons once they are old enough"...

Following the alien-colored light band, one can walk deeper past the Forge and arrive at the hypergravity field created by the Pseudo Sun. Mortals struggle to endure a stellar density of this degree. It is an inwardly collapsing disorder that only Ribhus artisans can traverse with ease.

The scorching stellar surges and abnormal celestial phenomena prevent the curious from continuing to approach the Pseudo Sun. All fundamental physical laws of the universe have been augmented to a terrifying degree in this space. Only one stout and powerful stellar race, the Ribhus, can survive in spaces with such gravitational abnormalities &mdash; The Ribhus are natural-born elite artisans. They pass between the Forge and the Pseudo Sun, and their perception of time has long strayed from that of normal beings. They keep their promise and continue to improve their artisanship, forging the ship's enormous cannons and keeping watch over the Pseudo Sun's slumber. The Xianzhou Zhuming regards Ribhus as loyal allies, respecting their tenacity and strength, while being grateful for their selfless sacrifice.

And yet, no being can follow the light bands further across the outlandish and twisted gravity field to dive deep into the Pseudo Sun. That is a place forbidden to all beings capable of emotion, a room where the endless dream of the Flint Emperor floats &mdash; The Xianzhou Zhuming is always on watch, for even the smallest sliver of emotional disturbances can awaken the boundless might of the heliobi progenitor.

There are frequently individuals who ignore the warning and cast their gaze upon the Pseudo Sun from afar. They would unknowingly slip into the psychological gravitational field, and their smallest carelessness would result in their sentience being taken away by the torrential mirages that pour out like a tide. Different from interacting with the gentle illusions, staring upon that "azure sun" would only make one feel the boundless rage that has been suppressed since the beginning of time &mdash; "The heliobi shall give the heroes enough power to scorch the very heavens, but when all duties have been fulfilled, the heroes must give to the heliobi supreme bodies forged into perfection..." No one knows how this ancient oath could be fulfilled. Similarly, none knows when the Flint Emperor would awaken from its bottomless dream.

Deep within the lotus lantern's wick, the Pseudo Sun heaves a profound sigh in its unending sleep. The Xianzhou ship slowly sails across the sky, leaving behind only an iridescent trail. In this way, the Xianzhou Zhuming will continue to ally with fire, journey with fire, and share its destiny with that of the fire.
