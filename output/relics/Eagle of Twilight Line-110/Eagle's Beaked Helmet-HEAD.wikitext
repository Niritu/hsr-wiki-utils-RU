{{Description|An aerodynamic helmet used in high-speed flights. It is shaped like the beak of a skyfish eagle.}}
'''Eagle's Beaked Helmet''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Eagle of Twilight Line]].

==Description==
Every day at dawn, Salsotto's skyfishers would depart from the moving city's skyport, soaring in the air with their winged suits, hunting for phlogiston jellyfish that flew out of the sand.

Phlogiston, an essential component of the Phase Flame, was the blood of the colossal moving city. Phlogiston must be sufficiently captured and gathered to ensure that the whole city could always stay ahead before the twilight zone that divided day and night.

If any skyfishers died from exhaustion or were attacked by giant birds, Salsottians would spare no effort in bringing back their remains and would bury their winged suits and eagle helmets with them in the dark land. According to the traditional Salsottian rituals, "landing" equals death and is a symbol of eternal rest.

The flight must never stop, just like how the city must never stop moving.

This eagle helmet has a short condolence message carved on its beak: "Landing is not the eagles' shackle, wings are, because of which you have to fly."
