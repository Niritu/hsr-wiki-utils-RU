{{Description|A ring worn by an outstanding skyfisher master, with a pair of skyfish eagle's wings holding tight the wearer's finger.}}
'''Eagle's Soaring Ring''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Eagle of Twilight Line]].

==Description==
Only the most skilled, respected, and reliable skyfisher captains would receive a Soaring Ring. They blew their fishing whistles in the sky and seamlessly coordinated with one another, like they were the most sharp-eyed hunting eagles.

For the duration of each flight, each team member was lonely and vulnerable. All they could rely on were the 124 types of whistles that could be performed by their team captain.

Hence, there had long been a saying in Salsotto &mdash; "Skyfishers entrusted one-third of their lives to the rigorously developed technology, one-third to their ingeniously refined equipment, and one-third to their reliable lead skyfisher captain."

Being asked by so many families to take care of their skyfisher children, the team captain constantly felt the burden of this little ring he wore.

This Soaring Ring's etching was mottled, with one word engraved on the inner side of the ring: "Duty."
