{{Description|Puttees to keep the legs warm during flights, decorated with a skyfish eagle's bristle feathers.}}
'''Eagle's Quilted Puttees''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Eagle of Twilight Line]].

==Description==
Hunting phlogiston jellyfish was a long survival game for skyfishers from Salsotto. Legs, being far from the heart, can only maintain their temperature when tightly strapped in fluffy feather puttees.

Only at the end of the long and highly stressful hunt would an exhausted skyfisher begin to feel pain and fatigue.

For those unprepared, it would be too late to discover their partial necrosis caused by severe frostbite. Therefore, skyfishers would check if they had tightened their puttees many times before taking off. After all, they wouldn't get another chance to do so in high-speed flight.

They knew what the wind would take away as they stepped into the sky.

Traces of lime powder and aluminum powder were found in the metal shell embedded in the puttee, which seemed to be a means of emergency heating.
