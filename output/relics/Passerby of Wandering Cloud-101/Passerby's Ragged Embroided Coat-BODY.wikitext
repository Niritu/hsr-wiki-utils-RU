'''Passerby's Ragged Embroided Coat''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Passerby of Wandering Cloud]].

==Description==
The unnamed roamed everywhere in his exile like a walking corpse, until a woman in sunglasses and a person wearing colossal armor stood in his way. Before they could extend their invitation, the unnamed had already unsheathed his sword in refusal. After an exchange of blows, the smiling woman offered a deal that the unnamed could not refuse.

The unnamed accepted the deal, obtained a new identity, and went back to the world of civilization and order.

The unnamed was brought into a tailor's shop, where his sizes were measured, and presentable clothes were custom-made... People even dressed his hair, groomed his face, and made him regain his old appearance. In a trance, he began to lose track of time. In hazy memories of the olden days, he finally made up his mind to gift his bosom friend with his hand-made jade flask, only to realize with a shock that the person he longed for was no longer there.

He realized that everything he relied on to walk this earth &mdash; this body, this life, this love and hatred, and even this set of clothes &mdash; were just loaned items.

He will repay all of them in full, then draw his last breath.
