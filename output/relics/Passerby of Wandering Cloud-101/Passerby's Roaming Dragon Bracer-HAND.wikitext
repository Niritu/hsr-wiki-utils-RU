{{Description|Bracers made from flowing coral gold and the leather of unknown beasts. Only master artisans from the Vidyadhara dragon race can create this kind of superior armor.}}
'''Passerby's Roaming Dragon Bracer''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Passerby of Wandering Cloud]].

==Description==
It seems that pairs of objects have telepathic connections with each other. Though the unnamed only had one bracer in his possession, his fingertips could still faintly feel the temperature from the other.

He closed his eyes, trying his best to extract any information about the other bracer from the tenuous connection, be it its location or master.

A slender yet strong hand once wore the other bracer. That owner, whose sharp spear glinted with a cold light and flourished like shooting stars, once sparred with the unnamed. That owner also once shared company and drinks with the unnamed, the two of them simply gazing at the moon with no words exchanged. However, in the end, it was also this person who stubbornly adhered to their plans with the unnamed, turned the beloved into a monstrosity, and pushed all into an abyss of eternal hatred and remorse.

Pairs of objects are destined for an eventual reunion. The long years of grudges and hatred between them should be savored, like ice-cold aged liquor, one slow sip after another until the bottle of resentment is finally empty.

Would the wearer of the other bracer feel the same? The unnamed didn't want to know.
