{{Description|A durable pair of boots that have left shoe-prints on many worlds and have witnessed many lethal situations.}}
'''Passerby's Stygian Hiking Boots''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Passerby of Wandering Cloud]].

==Description==
The unnamed followed the slave's orders and traveled to the other side of the sky with his new companions. He walked with bewilderment and hatred among countless worlds, often finding himself in grave crises of life and death.

He had long forgotten the joy of creation, lost in his hurries from one battlefield to the next.

In his past battles, he had sustained an innumerable number of sword slashes and cuts. In his past defeats, his body was splintered and smashed into pieces over and over again. His opponent would always end the battle with one finishing move right through his heart. And now, all those masterly sword moves that had induced his numerous scars were forever imprinted in his memory, and his martial prowess was refined in countless lethal encounters. The unnamed wielded his sword and slashed his way through obstacles for his allies. Wherever he fell, he rose right up, over and over again. He seemed to have let go of all his hatred in his dedication to the sword dance.

The slave promised to bring an eternal end and a final funeral to the unnamed's life and to everything he had ever hated. The unnamed nodded, put his sword back in its sheath, then raced to the next world.

If life could be deemed as a continuous journey, then the unnamed wishes to step over the pool of blood made of all whom he deeply resented before reaching his own end.
