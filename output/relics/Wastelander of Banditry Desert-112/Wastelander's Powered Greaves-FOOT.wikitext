{{Description|The leg part of powered armor, an exoskeleton made from scrap metals and old wires.}}
'''Wastelander's Powered Greaves''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Wastelander of Banditry Desert]].

==Description==
Nailscrap Town's bandits needed some means to defend their hard-earned water sources and junks, which was how the subpar banditry technology came to be. The powered armor was needlessly flamboyant, with its leg parts being the only functional section

"I need a whole set of fully powered armor, and now you are telling me all the sections above were all blown up!? Ask yourself if you dared to wear this set of greaves yourself!"

The defenses of Nailscrap Town that happened every now and then boosted the wartime development of Sensory Technology. Once, a random idea hit the engineers. With some materials of unknown source, they produced a set of powered armor. Unfortunately, only the leg part of the first generation of that cheap powered armor has survived. Even after being greatly simplified, the greaves still allow their wearer to take off like a rocket &mdash; a mechanism that confuses engineers nowadays.

According to the engineers, the design was completed in the limbo between dreams and reality. It was a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece of sheer ingenuity.

A useful piece of junk is a good piece of junk, be it recyclable or hazardous.
