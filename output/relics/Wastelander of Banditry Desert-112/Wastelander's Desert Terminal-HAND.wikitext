'''Wastelander's Desert Terminal''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Wastelander of Banditry Desert]].

==Description==
Before Talia became the "Kingdom of Banditry," it was notoriously reviled as the "Junkyard of the Cosmos." Discarded junk of old technology from other planets became another man's treasure here.

"Don't ever ask me if I enjoy wearing a mobile device heavier than shackles. It came in handy and was more powerful than a hammer in the most decisive moments."

After Nailscrap Town was established, the most unconventional of Talian wasteland engineers finally had a safe and secure location to exhibit their outrageous idea, creating Talia's unique "Sensory Technology." By combining a cesium dust counter and a cheeky-AI mobile device, they gave birth to the Desert Terminal, a multi-functional invention from wasteland junk.

The core idea for the so-called "Sensory Technology" is &mdash; Don't ask how, don't ask why, nobody cares.

"You attached that piece of junk to me? You rump-fed, scurvy sewer rat..." The AI terminal speaks with a tone of honesty and earnestness.
