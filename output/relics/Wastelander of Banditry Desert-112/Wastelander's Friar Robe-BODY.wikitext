'''Wastelander's Friar Robe''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Wastelander of Banditry Desert]].

==Description==
Most of the gangsters in Talia have never expected salvation, nor do they know about friars. All they knew was that their robes looked useful enough as cleaning rags.

"'Ignorance is still king'? What a load of nonsense!"

Wastelanders found a monastery that had long since lain desolate and discovered some ancient volumes from an old civilization. Their gut feeling was that the recordings were precious. After hypocritically feigning appreciation, they happily burned those books to ashes, only taking along the robes left by the friars. After all, the other things wouldn't be worth a penny in Nailscrap Town.

Most Wastelanders were illiterate. No amount of records of civilization would be more useful to them than a hot meal. And they were not the ones to blame.

At least, the robes of friars remained, contributing to the continued existence of a long-forgotten civilization.
