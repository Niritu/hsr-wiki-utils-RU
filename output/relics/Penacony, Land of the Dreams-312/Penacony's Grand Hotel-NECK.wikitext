{{Description|Encapsulated in the plane is Penacony's main structure &mdash; the Reverie hotel. Guests staying here will travel to a world of sweet dreams and enjoy a feast of luxury and extravagance in a seemingly omnipotent metropolis.}}
'''Penacony's Grand Hotel''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Penacony, Land of the Dreams]].

==Description==
The attendants bow and salute with uniform smiles, and greet the guests with music: "Welcome to the Planet of Festivities! Beautiful dreams await you." The guests smile as they move forward, accepting their drinks infused full of bubbles and gulping them down.

The scenery gradually becomes more and more incredulous, and the senses feel as if one has been lifted by silk. Guests from other lands defy gravity and walk on walls. Strange toys come to life and roam the streets in celebration. The water from the spring turn into a giant whale and swim through the halls. Opening a window no longer show a view of the stars in the deep sky, but of the city's shifting streams of light and shadows, holding up the constant echoes of giant clocks and theaters. The guests finally realize that they were never awake, but are instead witnessing Penacony's true nature in a dream &mdash; a place where time stops in a neverending dreamscape.

Everyone knows that, under the rule of "The Family," the doors of Penacony are open to everyone amidst the stars. For a transcendent experience, for an inspirational excitement, for the soothing of worries and wounds &mdash; guests of the highest caliber come to surrender their pain in exchange for peace and tranquility, to drink the best of the best, and to wander in the sea of dreams. Some spend unforgettable holidays here and leave content, while others become obsessed with the festivities and settle down here. The star-studded hotel is the jewel of dream weavers, the kingdom of dream makers, and the playground of dream seekers.

Few guests are aware of the dusty history of the past &mdash; the thread that weaves the dreams comes from reality. The velvety splendor of today's Penacony was born of salty rust, heavy shackles, and deprived freedom. The Planet of Festivities was once an IPC prison, where countless inmates were relocated to salvage the overflowing Memory Bubbles for the Garden of Recollection. People repeated their endless toils until their bodies were as heavy as lead, but their souls became as light as bubbles. At some unknown point in time, the small cells cut off access to reality, but people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. In the midnight bell, that shared dream seemed so real, reflecting the sheer hypocrisy of reality.

It lasted until the Destruction melted the chains of the IPC, the Trailblaze connected this frontier to the other stars, and the Harmony arrived upon invitation to sow the seeds of peace. Freedom finally broke ground and added a new name to the original dream &mdash; Penacony.

Today, there is no trace of the crumbling prison. In the dream world, a myriad of skyscrapers has been erected and the desert has been rebuilt and transformed into a metropolis &mdash; a new world for dreamers in search of wealth and opportunities, and a utopia for those in search of indulgence and pleasure. The past of the Planet of Festivities is like a photo that fell to the bottom of a cupboard &mdash; it exists, but is seen by no one.

Nowadays, the land of dreams is filled with songs of joy, and the noise of the past have been relegated to gossip, silently lost in the interlude of a comedy, in the behind-the-scenes of some cartoon, or in the side column of some magazine.
