==Description==
[ID] EVD-W019EI06-003

[Name] Crystal monocle

[Key Feature] Displays evident fractures

[Location] Bohdan laboratory in the Energy Research Lab, Ohioti Central Academy of Sciences

[Individual Involved] Bohdan, the Chief Scientist in the energy analysis field and member No. #7 of the Genius Society.

[Site Analysis]<br />The traces on the site indicate that the subject inadvertently triggered a reaction while operating the observation device, leading to Phlogiston leakage from the vessel and severe injury to the subject's left hand. During the incident, the monocle fell from a height and was fractured.

[Supplementary Testimony]<br />Bohdan mentioned abnormal visual light emissions in the monocle during experimentation, resulting in a series of coincidences that eventually led to the Phlogiston leak.

The testimony was deemed inadmissible due to an excessive number of coincidences mentioned by the witness.

[Additional Information]<br />Suspected as a premeditated criminal act. However, the cascading coincidences creating the Butterfly Effect did not constitute a reproducible criminal method, therefore this event was ultimately classified as an accident.

[Recording]<br />''"...This accident is actually a blessing in disguise, because it sent Lambda back to me again. Actually, this is our fourth remarriage... and it's a bit embarrassing to say, but this is MY first proposal for a remarriage." ''Sourced from Bohdan.
