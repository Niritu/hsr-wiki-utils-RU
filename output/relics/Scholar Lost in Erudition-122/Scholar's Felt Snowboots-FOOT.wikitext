==Description==
[ID] EVD-X031JA12-004

[Name] Women's snow boots for polar expeditions

[Key Feature] Displays evident signs of wear and repair, with a hidden disk in the sole. Possibilities of espionage have been preliminarily ruled out

[Location] Basement of Klein's House

[Individual Involved] Klein (deceased), the best scientist in alloy material science and member No. #9 of the Genius Society.

[Site Analysis]

A huge number of items belonging to the late scientist Lambda were found in Klein's home, including the these boots.

[Supplementary Testimony]<br />''"Maybe I was wrong about him... I mean, Klein. As for my late wife, Lambda... She's been away from me for a long while, and I just feel... unfamiliar about her."''

Bohdan was unaware of his wife's belongings in Klein's home but displayed no visible surprise upon discovery.

[Additional Information]<br />Klein's residence is located in a remote area with no visitors around the time of death as determined by the coroner. The preliminary diagnosis is accidental death.

Bohdan, Lambda, and Klein shared a unique relationship and the series of "coincidences" they experienced border on supernatural phenomena.

[Recording]<br />''"*Sigh* I know you doubt me, Bohdan, and I know I can't prove my innocence to you. I'm very sorry for what happened to Lambda. I feel guilty, but I'm the last one who would ever deliberately harm her... In fact, I have some leads about the murderer's identity. Have you ever heard of the Lord of Silence?... *noise*" ''Sourced from the disk hidden in the boots.
