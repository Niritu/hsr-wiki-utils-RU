{{Description|An exoskeleton crafted from an alloy that aids finger movements, tailored to the user's hand and of significant value.}}
'''Scholar's Auxiliary Knuckle''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Scholar Lost in Erudition]].

==Description==
[ID] EVD-X024DE18-002

[Name] Finger exoskeleton infused with Grayseal Gold alloy

[Key Feature] Displays signs of external damage. Confirmed to have been damaged before the explosion

[Location] Central control room, polar energy excavation site

[Individual Involved] Lambda (deceased), the best scientist in bio-wave detection science and member No. #8 of the Genius Society.

[Site Analysis]<br />Surveillance footage indicates the subject's improper operation led to a volatile explosion in the central control room, which immediately killed the subject.

[Supplementary Testimony]<br />''"God knows what secrets she's been hiding, but if anything happens to her, Klein definitely has something in it!"''

Two weeks prior to the explosion, Bohdan filed a report, stating that a thug had harmed his wife's disabled right hand. However, Lambda, the actual victim, declined further investigation and withdrew the case.

[Additional Information]<br />After the explosion, the subject's husband requested to retrieve the exoskeleton along with the subject's finger bones once the investigation was over.<br />Given the string of incredible coincidences in this incident, this case is recommended for high priority.

[Recording]<br />''"Come to me, Klein! We've got to settle this score! Both you and I know well there are no such things as 'coincidences' in this world, let alone this unbelievable string of them."''Sourced from the security system in Klein's house.
