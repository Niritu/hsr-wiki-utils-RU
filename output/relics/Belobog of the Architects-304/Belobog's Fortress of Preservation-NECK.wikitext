==Description==
Thousands of years ago, Jarilo-VI's climate was balmy year-round, and ocean vistas that were the envy of all.

Sweet fruits dangled upon boughs in the forests and humid warmth was brought by the tides, while ambrosial wine overflowed like springwater for all to partake in. The locals were full of vigor and ambition, constructing roads, cities, seaside villas, and palaces of grandeur. Their rich and satisfactory life always started with a cup of hot coffee in the morning, and ended with a jug of malt brew at dusk.

Soon, the star rail connected with Jarilo-VI's world, bringing in interstellar trade and extra-celestial technology.

In the beginning, otherworldly visitors came in pursuit of Geomarrow. This crystal clear mineral contained energy that served as the lifeblood of industrialization, and their amber-colored reflections sparked with Preservation's light. Later, visitors came here to settle and live a peaceful life. Jarilo-VI's picturesque bays, palm trees, and joyous melodies made it a perfect destination for any tired traveler. People believed that, given time, this humid planet would shine as bright as any other planet of renown throughout the cosmos.

About a thousand years ago, a Stellaron fell through the atmosphere and landed on this world.

Immediately thereafter, the planet was plunged into chaos, like something out of an utterly absurd farce. Destruction's catastrophic Legion descended from the sky, and the flames of war surged across the lands. The Architects built defensive walls and fortifications, and hundred-meter constructs contended with draconian monstrosities... Then, an unending cold front suddenly appeared, and a chilling blizzard swallowed friend and foe alike. The whole planet was shrouded in utter silence, with an invisible spatial barrier covered a single fortress city, like the flame of a candle being protected in a person's embrace during a cold night. That was how civilization survived.

Later, this city was to be named Belobog.
