'''Belobog's Iron Defense''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Belobog of the Architects]].

==Description==
The Architects had great hopes for Jarilo-VI before the calamity.

Mimicking Qlipoth's power, the Architects created machinery that could terraform planets. Hundreds of fire-breathing Engines of Creation roared across the land, like giant gardeners cultivating abandoned flower beds. Mere decades later, valleys and hills were remade into plains and forests, and cities were thickly dotted along the coast.

After the arrival of Destruction's omen, the Architects sent all their machines into war, making them the first guards of the "Iron Defense."

Following the arrival of the Stellaron, soldiers of destruction landed like moths to flame, leaving tracks of desolation on the planet's surface. The machines once used for creation were now forced to become weapons of war, throwing their iron fists on battlefields where they didn't belong. Eventually, the giant gardeners fell to the ground in exhaustion like tombstones of a civilization, marking the gradual collapse of the defense line.

On the day when there was no more room for retreat, Silvermane Guards held tightly onto their weapons, for their homeland was mere steps behind.

The arrival of the Eternal Freeze came as a surprise to everyone. The monsters from beyond the sky and the soldiers on the front lines were trading lethal blows when snow and ice filled up the whole battlefield. In utter chaos, Belobog became the only light in the whole world. The two sides fell into endless slaughter to either sniff out or protect this light. Roaring the name of Alisa Rand, the Guards re-entered into the snow storms and never returned.

The residents of Belobog only dared to climb up the city walls to look out when the blizzard halted.

And they beheld the final guards of the "Iron Defense."
