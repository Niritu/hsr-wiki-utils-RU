'''Knight's Solemn Breastplate''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Knight of Purity Palace]].

==Description==
The armor of the Solemn Knight must be blessed by Maiden Vanira, a ceremony where one makes a vow to become the guardian knight.

The Church once constrained the young devil's hands and feet in metal chains. Now, Safina appealed that her armor should be forged with metals from the land of devils, so that one day she may rest in peace alongside something from her homeland.

The Maiden of the Church of Purity Palace carefully washed the sins from the armor, recited reverent prayers to god, and sealed an ancient miracle on a point on the breastplate right above the heart. The Church did not believe in the loyalty of devils, but they were convinced that their doctrines could purify everything. Safina gazed in silence while this ancient ritual assigned the responsibility to her.

The Maiden did not believe that the ceremony had any purpose, or that there are any make-belief sins to be washed away.

"My dear Safina, the knight must protect the Maiden well." Leaning against Safina's breastplate, Vanira could clearly hear the intense beating of Safina's heart.
