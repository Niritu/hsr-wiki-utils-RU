'''Knight's Silent Oath Ring''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Knight of Purity Palace]].

==Description==
Bit by bit, solemnity and decorum crumbled, and the Knights of the Church raised their swords against each other as the rings they swore to protect grew dim.

The power granted from the stellar seas gifted the Church the strength to punish devils, but also spread an insanity that ate away at human rationality.

Tormented by this madness, the Knights of the Church could no longer discern decorum and order, obsessed with expelling all devil-spawns for the salvation of the whole church. When these threats came for the Maiden, Safina had no time to hesitate. She cannot stay her hand even if her opponent was the Arch Knight of the Church of Purity Palace.

The Solemn Knight must always protect and defend the Maiden. Safina did not forget that creed.

"My dear Safina, there is no need to feel guilty. This is the consequence of coveting the power of the Aeons." All there were left in the church were the last Maiden and her guardian knight.
