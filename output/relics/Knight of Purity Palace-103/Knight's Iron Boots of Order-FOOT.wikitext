'''Knight's Iron Boots of Order''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Knight of Purity Palace]].

==Description==
After the collapse of the Church of Purity Palace, Safina took off the knight's iron boots and embarked with Maiden Vanira on a long journey to the land of devils.

At the request of the Maiden, Safina did not let any Knights of the Church carry the madness out of the Church. This secret was forever buried deep down in their hearts.

No one knew when this rumor started &mdash; a devil-spawn once banished by the Church had possessed the holy Solemn Knight, and an evil witch drove the Knight to break down the order of the pontiff... As time passed, rumors became truths. The devout followers of the Church blamed it all on the Solemn Knight, dumping all their desperation and madness onto her, deeming her as the source of all disasters.

After losing their place of refuge, the Maiden suggested that they should set forth for their homeland.

"Henceforth, I will become a witch, and you will return to being a devil." Safina could not deny the validity of Vanira's statement.
