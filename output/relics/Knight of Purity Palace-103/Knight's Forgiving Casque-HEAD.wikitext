{{Description|A casque that resembles the religious stone statues of the Goddess of Forgiveness. It was used to hide the wearer's appearance.}}
'''Knight's Forgiving Casque''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Knight of Purity Palace]].

==Description==
The Solemn Knight had never taken off her hard and heavy casque before anybody. Safina's religious solemnity and silence projected an unbearable air of intimidation.

Haughty devils and mad clergy all instinctively cowered in fear before her solemn presence.

Only few of the clergy knew that Safina's devilish origins were concealed behind that casque of religiosity. The church both feared and craved for the devils' powers, which was how the conflicted result came to be... The church captured a newborn devil, trained her to become a valiant Solemn Knight, yet forbid her to ever reveal her true appearance, molded her to always obey the pontiff's order, and eventually made her the Maiden's silent knight.

Maiden Vanira was of a similar age to Safina, and she was the one who guided Safina to learn the scriptures. To this day, Maiden Vanira could still remember the devil's profile in candlelight.

"My dear Safina, I have seen your face. I will remember it, always." Maiden Vanira gradually lost her eyesight after reaching adulthood.
