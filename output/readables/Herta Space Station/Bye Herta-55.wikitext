==Text==
Darkness is gathering in the distance, using cruel methods...

To dissect time. Petals inquiring for love bend their lips,

Like the ticking chimes in an infinite time and space. We have no choice,

But to slide into the shivering calamities of the universe as if sliding down a slope into dusk.

And with that, the stars continue their enjoyment above as their elegant smiles fill the way forward.
