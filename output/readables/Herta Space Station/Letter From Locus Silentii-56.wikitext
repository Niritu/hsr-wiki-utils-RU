<div align="center">Upon the stars, that is where the talent and intellect reside. Oblivious to the world, as the envy becomes blinding.<br />
Who knew gentleness and kindness welcomed only pain and suffering. Like the risk of falling into the depths when trying to mount the sky.<br />
An inquiry into spirit traces, a glance into the site of storage. Even with iron shoes worn out unearthly, one has to visit the three depths.<br />
Better off alone than to be an accomplice. One day, as they turn around, a path will be lit by the radiance of the stars.
