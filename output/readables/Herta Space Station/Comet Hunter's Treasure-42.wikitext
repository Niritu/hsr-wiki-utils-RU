==Comet Hunter's Treasure==
===Comet Hunter's Treasure (I)===
To Treasure Hunters: (I)

Ha! You are fooled!<br />
There is no "treasure" at all.<br />
The only reward is the four scrawls by me hidden in this room. You must have recognized it. Yes, Madam Herta's likeness is in there as well. Surprised, eh?<br />
If you are a junior who worries all day to impress your boss, take a deep breath! No good if you have a heart attack now.<br />
If you are one of those playful young fellows, I'd suggest you take them, go back to them when you find life miserable and have a good laugh when you are not busy doing your research in a dark corner of the ivory tower.

===Comet Hunter's Treasure (II)===
To Treasure Hunters: (II)

Right, if you are reading this, you've probably listened to me. That means you always follow through with what you started.<br />
I have to admit, it would hurt my reputation had I asked you to go through so much trouble just for nothing.<br />
After all, I can't foresee to whom this letter will go so many Amber Eras later.<br />
There is a chance, however unlikely it may be, that you are a future defender of my reputation, someone worthy of my legacy.<br />
Wouldn't want to accidentally put you under friendly fire, would I?<br />
Hm, so be it. It's time that I bring forward the real treasure.

===Comet Hunter's Treasure (III)===
To Treasure Hunters: (III)

Have you tried a type of soda named "Kapo-Kali"?<br />
It was once the signature of the space station, extremely popular in the Southern Orion system.<br />
Sorry to brag, but I'm indeed the creator of the famous Astro Rod and Cosmos Guide.<br />
And undoubtedly, "Kapo-Kali" is also my creation.<br />
The IPC offered me five million credits for the recipe and I turned them down.<br />
Wen Huairen from the Herta Department of Implement Arts attempted (and failed) to steal it 33 times, all resulting in him getting a good smack from me.<br />
I will now make the recipe public...<br />
Five million's worth! See you in the next letter.

===Comet Hunter's Treasure (IV)===
To Treasure Hunters: (IV)

Yes, you are seeing it right. Above is the secret recipe of Kapo-Kali.<br />
I swear on my Mom's life that it's authentic.<br />
If you are one of us, you'll know how to decrypt it.<br />
Got a tip for you: A specific method of autoradiography is required to reveal the text.
