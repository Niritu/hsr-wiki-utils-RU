<div align="center">Observational Records</div>

I no longer remember how long it's been since I arrived at Penacony... At any rate, the last few days were spent observing the many never-before-seen nor documented creatures here.<br />
I discovered a jellyfish species that can only be seen through a special filter, presenting what seemed like a bed of flowers blooming in the ocean.<br />
Hoping to see more of these magnificent creatures, I suited up with my equipment and dived into far deeper Memory Zones.<br />
But it was dark, pitch-black everywhere... The darkness that loomed over my consciousness suffocated and tormented me...<br />
A gigantic ship skidded past me. Resplendent lights illuminated its interiors, seemingly hosting a dance party attended by strange creatures. Looks like those legends are true after all.<br />
Soon after, it... it appeared before me...<br />
In the form of a thin and transparent membrane, crawling across the water's surface.<br />
My mind became waterlogged, as if ready to drip moisture and grow mold any time<br />
My soul is gliding through the air<br />
The daydream before my eyes is twisting and shattering<br />
I dive between water and air<br />
Witnessing ████<br />
I'm glowing with light ██, ████<br />
