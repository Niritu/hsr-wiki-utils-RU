==The Planet Of Canticles' Final Song: Song of Beauty Concert==
Music enthusiasts from all over the universe:

Did you know that there was once a "Planet of Canticles" in the cosmos called Mendasia. Under the guidance of Beauty, the people there indulged in singing and dancing, using the entire world as their platform to explore the beauty of music. Unfortunately, the deaf-mute destiny is incapable of appreciating art. This paradise fell along with their goddess before it could be known to the cosmos...

The planet's residents lost the gaze from the Beauty, but the magnanimous Great One of Harmony opened their arms for the people. Thanks to the Iris Family's effort, the remaining residents of the planet of canticles have arrived in Penacony. Larose Sallie, heir of the heritage of Mendasian folk songs and a famous musician, will present the lost Song of Beauty to you in the dream!

You are about to embark on a trip that traverses numerous Amber Eras. The voice of Mendasia will bring you back to the time when Idrila was still glowing in the universe and ignite your desire for beauty. Whether you are an ardent fan of classical music or a follower of cosmic pop music, this exceptional auditory extravaganza is not to be missed!

The Planet Of Canticles' Final Song: Mendasian Folk Song Concert will eternally preserve everything that is beautiful in this world via songs!
