==Quinn's Diary==
''' ■/■/■'''

I have an amazing sister, seriously! She's super smart and hardworking, and everybody loves her.

But she never seems to be happy...

I want her to be happy, but why didn't she like playing with me?

(A number of pages are skipped.)

''' ■/■/■'''

Today is our birthday, but I'm totally not feeling it.

Everyone prepared presents for us. I even got a huge doll for my sister! It cost me half a month's pocket money!

But she straight up forgot about my gift... Is she not fond of me or something?

(A number of pages are skipped.)

''' ■/■/■'''

Ugh, she's so annoying! She's always giving me lectures, but she was born just half a minute before me. Why always that attitude?

She's always telling me what I can and can't do, and she acts like it's for my own good. But deep down, she's just jealous that I don't have to bust my butt to get everyone's love!

She's always putting up a front, ugh! It's just so gross!

But whatever. I'm gonna do all the things she doesn't allow, and I'll make that witch super mad!

(A number of pages are skipped.)

''' ■/■/■'''

Oh no, a disaster! I accidentally broke that witch's violin...

And now she's gonna be all up in my ear. I already know what she's gonna say...

"You should know better at your age!" "Having a sister like you is such a shame!" "I don't wanna see your face ever again!" ... I've heard it all a million times over the years.

I'm so done with it. It's just a stupid violin anyway. I'll get her a new one or something.

Ahhh, my poor little piggy bank, back to being empty again...
