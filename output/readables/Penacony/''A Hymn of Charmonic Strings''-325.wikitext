O, Great One of Paradise,<br />Prayers you suckle from the millions gathered here, and the masses' heartstrings you play,<br />Stars trace your fingers and command all living's law and authority.<br />Dominicus, do you hear?<br />The road ahead is dark without anything.<br />Thus authority points to the right, and the chaos coalesces into a river of stars,<br />Thus law points to the left, and that which hinders vanish into mist,<br />Sweet dreams nowadays have manifested, and the gazillions of old laws have all faded away.

O, Great One of Paradise,<br />I sing praises in the fountain of your performance, calling for the love of the fathomless sky,<br />Within the theater, there lies a mercy that appeases and offers salvation to the world.<br />Constantina, do you hear?<br /> The audience's tears are washing this face.<br />Should you sing, then the sun will shine for you,<br />Should you play music, then filth will speed to slumber,<br />The Thousand Faces' plays shall never cease, and the eternal theaters forever linked.

O, Great One of Paradise,<br />Caress this scripture that is stained by blood on the battlefield, and kiss my longsword of bone and soul,<br />Life is howling, and the sharp blade of streaming colors hangs high.<br />Aelenev, do you hear?<br />The soldiers' bones are buried at the end of the world.<br />Comrades' whisper united, and the gospel can be heard for miles long,<br />Blissful rain pours out thus, and one person equals to thousands.<br />Thought they be the invincible steeds and death, they too long for their home deep in their soul.

O, Great One of Paradise,<br />I invite you to cast your gaze upon the other side of brilliance, and to attend the feast of this paradise.<br />The world is a ball, laughter resounds till the end.<br />Beatriz, do you hear?<br /> Singing, dancing, joys transcend.<br />Sorrows have nowhere to hide, and desire tiptoes,<br />Feast! Feast! Boundless happiness! Boundless happiness!<br />Even babes show a smiling face. Dance! Dance! Towards that honey-sweet paradise.
