'''· ''Befensol, The Suffering of Two Skies'' - General - Planetary Record 2A-459'''<br />
Tells the story of a distant twin planetary system known as "Befensol." A portion of the book takes the form of a novel, credibility unknown.<br />
This star system is characterized by a "concept of high symmetry." There exists a corresponding relationship between intelligent civilizations on each planet, with each life form's basic structure forming a concept similar to the "antimatter" of the other. Contact between the two would cause annihilation.<br />
According to a description in the book itself: "...Everyone knows that there exists a 'fated other' on the other side of the rift in the sky. They are fated to attract each other, yet will never be able to make contact..."<br />
''-The author was born on Befensol β, and the status column says "missing."''

'''· ''Hello! I'm Hungry!'' Cookbook 3H-331'''<br />
A comprehensive, multi-realm cookbook. Entries are extremely complicated and meticulously categorized according to home world and race, for instance:<br />
"Boiled millet with berries" &mdash; a staple dish for the Zatzka

"Raw tiber pickles" - an Abelane Galaxy specialty<br />
There are also a number of entries for which the ingredients are extremely hard to source, and there's almost no way to recreate the dishes.<br />
The author is unknown. I imagine they were some kind of follower of Voracity or Trailblaze, though it could have also been a gluttonous Memokeeper.<br />
Note: This book is very hungry.<br />
''- A dry joke? I didn't think the entry clerk would have a sense of humor?<br />
Follow-up: All the books in 3H have been reported missing. Why did no one tell me this was a Memory Zone Meme!?<br />
Another follow-up: All the books in 3H were recipe books, and the contents have all been absorbed and converted by this book. I see... Well, looks like the topic for my dissertation this semester is set!''

'''<u>Lent out</u>'''<br />
'''· ''Difference Engine's Categories, Structure, and Application Examples'' Natural Science - Astronomy 6A-061, 100 days'''<br />
''- The borrower is a postgraduate studying under a professor of Dreamweaver Academy's astral aesthetics. The book is to be used for their graduation design and the application came with a letter of introduction. An extended loan period has thus been approved.''

'''· ''Ambition &mdash; Tales of Louis Fleming'' - Modern Literature - Satire 15C-180, 14 days'''<br />
''- 43rd Edition of Tales of Louis Fleming loaned out. The contents of each version are all completely different. Does the IPC not care about this?<br />
- It's easy to confuse it with the book on the shelf next to it. Fortunately, no one ever borrows that one.''

'''· ''Enchanting Idols of the Theater of Limitations'' Art Collection 10A-001, 3 days'''<br />
''- I took a look at the contents due to the interesting serial number and found that these are the design sketches for the Grand Theater. This book has been in the library gathering dust since the day the theater was completed. This is the first time it has been loaned out after all these Amber Eras.<br />
Follow-up: When I was recording this collection, I noticed a number of the pages were stained, and the stains looked a little like SoulGlad... Did they have SoulGlad back then?''

'''· ''Singing Willow in the Magnetic Furnace'' General - Planetary record 2B-010, 12 days (not overdue)'''<br />
''- The original book is made of francium. While it should be okay inside the dreamscape... be careful when returning it to the shelves. Maybe we'll just allow it to float to the very top.''

'''· ''Moment of Stars Sponsor List'' Historical document 9G-011'''<br />
Amber Era 2158 First Edition. The 370th edition in total<br />
Records the name of every organization and individual that has previously sponsored the Moment of Stars athletics competition, ranked in order of their contributions. The entire book contains over 70 pages, with many familiar names inside: Cosmic superstars, renowned interastral trillionaires, even two living Genius Society members...<br />
''- "Anonymous (telepathic spider) - 700,000 Alfalfa credits, Esteemed Qian Ketong - 700,000 Alfalfa credits... Mr. Neony - 15 Alfalfa credits?" <s>You could get more from a street cash-spewer than what this guy donated!</s> It's clear to see that the organizers of the competition care a lot about each individual donor's kindness.''

'''· ''Spectral Hero'' Modern literature - fantasy novel 15A-545'''<br />
The novel is told in the first-person and describes the story of a normal Hynes person traveling to a fictional planet system with seven moons.<br />
Due to how the characteristics of their race enhanced to six times its original size and caused a lot of problems, the protagonist also simultaneously becomes the planet's hero through a series of unexpected events. In the end, the main character decides to live on this planet permanently.<br />
''- It's a novel that's popular with Hynes youngsters. I imagine many of them have fantasized about themselves experiencing the same events. Unfortunately, the majority of 7-moon planets that we've discovered so far appear to have almost no intelligent life...''
