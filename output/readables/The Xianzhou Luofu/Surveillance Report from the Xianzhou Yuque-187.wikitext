'''For Chief Counselor Qingzu's eyes only,'''

The Xianzhou Yuque is currently trekking around the periphery of the Giant's Arm star cluster, plotting an ancient course as it continues explorations.

Twenty-six sidereal hours ago, the Cloudpeer Telescope captured signals from Reignbow's Lux Arrow traversing through three of its coordinates. The master diviner has interpreted this as a divine mandate.

The Marshal issued orders, and the Yaoqing Cloud Knights' Heroncrest Fleet and Red Ballad Fleet have both set out on patrol as hereby informed.

We also include a recent scouting report of enemy movements for strategic planning.

Regards,<br />
Divination Commission, Xianzhou Yuque'''


<br />'''Must be opened with Chief Counselor's Seal'''</div>

{{Size|32|[The Borisin]}}

The Great Brood Lord Angsin leads his hunting pack into the Echidna skywall, struggling to fight off the hostile Shepherds Fleet.<br />
Their fleet consists of 16 beast ships and 325 battleships.<br />
We expect to observe the borisin's internal war in the upcoming days. We will send out another battle report once the time comes.

Threat posed to the Luofu: Very low.

{{Size|32|[The Wingweavers]}}

Based on IPC data, the wingweavers' Peacock Angel legion has arrived at the Consternation Starzone to locate a Stellaron and revive their homeworld of Muldrasil.<br />
The veracity of this information is yet to be verified.

Threat posed to the Luofu: Very low.

{{Size|32|[Antimatter Legion]}}

An industrial planet along the Luofu's route, the Baranza Forge, has been completely neutralized by the Lord Ravager Irontomb's assault.<br />
Diviners have performed calculations, and the probability of victory is infinitesimally close to zero.

Threat to the Luofu: Medium low.<br />
Suggested countermeasures: Order the Divination Commission to monitor electrical signals from Irontomb's vehicle, and remain vigilant about its movements.
