"The general has been ill for a long time &mdash; her qi and blood circulation is irregular, and she is prone to irritation. She also suffers exhaustion from years of battle, internal bleeding and vascular and qi obstructions. She requires long-term care and must take this decoction every ten days. Avoid spicy food during this time and make sure to eat dinner."

<br />"The general's extreme speed can easily disturb her mental state. Therefore, as well as treating her eyes, there should be supplementary drugs provided to calm her mind and soothe her will. Use 5 mace of jujube seeds, 3 mace of polygala, and 1 mace of licorice root to brew a cold complementary medicinal tea."

<br />...This prescription's main functions are to regulate body functions, dispel heat and wind from the body, and slow down myolysis and muscular calcification.

Recipe:<br />''<div align="center">Cut the hind-leg sections of an Ever-Hunt Plains Fungus Boar into sections and rinse off any blood</div>''<br />''<div align="center">Half a cup of powdered Thalassan dung beetle powder</div>''<br />''<div align="center">Quarter cup of powdered Vidyadhara hatching rebirth eggshells</div>''<br />''<div align="center">2 mace of Fanghu Fossil Root</div>''<br />''<div align="center">0.5 mace of dehydrated viscorpus</div>''<br />''<div align="center">2 rock bamboos, washed and put aside</div>''<br />''<div align="center">Place the fungus boar leg meat and bones in a casserole dish together with fire ginger</div>''<br />''<div align="center">Extract the salt from the Lunarescent Seawater and pour the desalinated water into the casserole to boil together for 1 dual-hour</div>''<br />''<div align="center">Skim off the scum and add the rock bamboos and dehydrated viscorpus before boiling for half a dual-hour</div>''<br />''<div align="center">When removing from the pot, add the medicinal powder to the soup, with Zhuming pepper to counteract the medicinal flavor</div>''

<br />"The root of the general's condition is an extended overdraft of her own vitality. Toxins within her muscles have not been dispersed, leading to muscular damage and breakdown. We must rely on food supplements to cleanse the toxins in her blood and repair her muscles and bones."
