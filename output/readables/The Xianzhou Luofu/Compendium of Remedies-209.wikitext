{{Size|32|Stone Calf Cimicifugae Infusion}}

Classification:<br />
Orthopedics

Main indication:<br />
Pain from regrowing a broken tooth. Pain from obstructed wisdom teeth growth.

Prescription:<br />
Draconic liquorice 4 mace, mountain devil mint 1 mace, droppings from blue-winged squirrels 2 mace, Insumousu steadfast teeth 1 packet (the ones produced by Suparutoi Pharmaceuticals are the best).

Dosage:<br />
Boil in hot water, then filter out and throw away any residue. Drink the liquid three times a day and finish the entire infusion over the course of one day. It tastes fishy and bitter. Please add powdered sugar when ingesting according to your preference.

Those who suffer from the pain of a broken tooth should take this when the tooth is growing back. Those who suffer from obstructed wisdom teeth should take this every day. Do not take more than one infusion per day. Contraindicated with the pain-soothing infusion, thousand-manifestation infusion, supreme liberation pellet, and red cockroach sweet-salty ointment. Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding, however the infusion can be held in the mouth and spat out once the pain recedes, followed by rinsing the mouth with fresh water.

History:<br />
This is an ancient prescription aimed at soothing excessive teeth growth in Xianzhou natives. In year 6652 of the Star Calendar, Baize, Cauldron Master of the Alchemy Commission, altered the two components of draconic liquorice and steadfast teeth, replacing them with extracts of cloud poria grown on the Yaoqing and rock salt crystals from Insumousu respectively. This medicine can effectively cure obstructed teeth growth (for approximately twenty years).

{{Size|32|Clear-Head Flowing-Meridian Infusion}}

Classification:<br />
Psycho Analysis

Main indication:<br />
Intense emotional fluctuations such as fear and horror.

Prescription:<br />
Calming-valerian extracts 1 mace, qi-strengthening infusion 1 mace, plains flowers 1 mace 3 candareen, golden melon berry extracts 4 candareen.

Dosage:<br />
The medicine is in powder form. It can be dissolved in water and drank, or made into pellets and swallowed.<br />
The medication should be taken immediately as required. Once emotionally stable, the patient no longer needs to ingest this medicine.

History:<br />
This prescription had existed before the formation of the Alliance. After signing a trade agreement for the first time with the IPC, the Alchemy Commission welcomed an academic exchange visit from the Intelligentsia Guild's Troops of the Learned, and the two parties exchanged information. The alchemist Muyan transplanted into medical herbs the chemical compounds that reduced psychological arousal in the original prescription, breeding this brand-new medical plant called "calming-valerian."

Clear-head flowing-meridian infusion is a must-have when warring against the borisin. After ingestion, this medicine helps the Cloud Knights to suppress the fear incited by the borisin's pheromones.

After the Reignbow destroyed the Ambrosial Arbor, the Alchemy Commission never stopped investigating the Arbor's remains and innovated to produce components that can be used as medicine.

This medication is a must-have for the Cloud Knights during warfare.

{{Size|32|Injection of Past Life in Dreams}}

Classification:<br />
Hatching Rebirth

Main indication:<br />
Vidyadhara that ingest this after their hatching rebirth can remember their past life.

Prescription:<br />
Powdered dragon scale coral 1 mace, extracts from dream-speaker flower fruits 1 mace 3 candareen, calming-valerian extracts 3 candareen, white-hair ivy extracts 2 candareen.

Dosage:<br />
Inject using golden needle after concocting the infusion.<br />
Clinical evidence shows this prescription should be used within five years after hatching rebirth.<br />
The patient will be able to regain memories of their previous life via dreams. However, the quantity and level of clarity of these memories are unable to be controlled.

History:<br />
According to Vidyadhara legends, this prescription was made by the alchemist Qinglu for their lover. Qinglu did not want their relationship to be over and wanted to continue it in their next reincarnation.<br />
This prescription goes against the cultural traditions and laws of the Vidyadhara. It should not be used except when the very survival of the Vidyadhara race is at risk.<br />
It is an offense against the laws of the Vidyadhara to use the injection of past life in dreams on a Vidyadhara against their will, through coercion, or by force. The offender will suffer the punishment of rebirth.

To alleviate symptoms in early-stage mara-struck and slow down the development of mara.

(Spiritfarers of the Ten-Lords Commission will locate the patient before symptoms of mara manifest and guide them to the afterlife. Please do not use this prescription without permission.)
