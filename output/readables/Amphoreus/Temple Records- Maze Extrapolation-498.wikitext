Request: "Where are my lenses?"<br />
Divination Result: "On your nose"

Request: "What is one plus one?"<br />
Divination invalid, nature of question incompatible.<br />
※ Note: Receiving priests should conduct preliminary screening. The Maze can only divine matters of "location." Keep invalid questions from disturbing the sacred process.

Request: "Where lies the answer to one plus one?"<br />
Divination Result: "Within the confines of your mind"<br />
※ Note: Three subsequent identical queries were archived.

Request: "Where is the jewelry I shall cherish most?"<br />
Divination Result: "Along the path to Icaria"<br />
※ Note: Similar request from Strife Season was made by the same person, who left the city after receiving the prophecy.

Request: "Where is Aitee hiding?"<br />
Divination Result: "Beside you"<br />
※ Note: Due to lengthy processing times, playful children's queries (especially hide-and-seek related) should not be treated as formal requests.<br />
※ Note: According to Priest Monnta, the client was playing with the sought child when the slate was delivered, matching the divination result.

Request: "Where is tomorrow?"<br />
Divination Result: "Fifteen days past"<br />
※ Note: Total time from request to slate delivery was seventeen days.

Request: "Location of the previous Holy Maiden"<br />
Divination Result: ████<br />
※ Note: Process per protocol, future similar queries need not be processed or recorded.

Request: "Where has my new acolyte gone? Where are the clues that lead to his whereabouts?"<br />
Divination Result: "At the Grove of Epiphany, look to the desk"<br />
※ Note: The client was Priest Monnta, who found a farewell message and handcrafted gifts atop the desk.

Request: "Where is my child?"<br />
Divination Result: "At home"<br /><s>※ Note: Childish play, not recommended for processing.</s><br />※ Note: Priest Monnta disagreed, emphasizing the child's safety as a priority.

Request: "Where is the plainest piece from the tea set offered to Oronyx this time?"<br />
Divination Result: "In Dagra's pocket"<br />
※ Note: The client expressed gratitude and stated no further action was needed if a priest borrowed the piece.<br />
※ Note: That person wasn't even a priest! Why didn't they check first?<br />
※ Note: Never mind, the client has left.

※ Note: Dismissed the temporary acolyte from Creation Season.

Request: "Where might a worthy acolyte be found?"<br />
Divination Result: "Patience shall provide"

Request: "Please find me."<br />
Divination paths too complex for even three priests to decipher, request terminated mid-process.<br />
