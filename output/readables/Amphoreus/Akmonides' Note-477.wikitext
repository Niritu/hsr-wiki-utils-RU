===(I)===
The poor boy from the blacksmith shop has gotten above their station~

That love-blinded young fool... Does he really believe that he can escape the quagmire of power with his loved one and find this so-called happiness ever after?

===(II)===
How could a Gardener in the Garden of Life be a bad person?

They are all pure and noble scholars that cannot be blinded by wealth or tempted into breaking the law... They must be, right?

===(III)===
What should I do when I grow weary of daily life in the baths?

Go and talk to the staff~ The architects, the mathematicians, the "cleaners"... If you can get them to open up to you, you're bound to be entertained.
