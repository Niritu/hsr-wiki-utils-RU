       ...

       For many years, Janusopolis has relied on the rose myrtle to obtain the boon of the gods. We have spent five or six years now digging out its roots and cutting back its branches. Now, this red tree is on the verge of collapse and has long since ceased to serve its purpose, yet it still seeks to spread out its canopy and eclipse Janusopolis from the glorious rays. We have a secret plan to fell this tree. We just need to wait for the ceremony to make a small move, and the rose myrtle will slip and fall into the abyss... Janusopolis is built on a mountainside &mdash; there are more than a few cases of people who have lost their footing in its history.

       ...

       As for the next sacred tree, we were planning on selecting another puppet. As for the rose myrtle's daughter, Tribios... We'll call her saffron for now. In my eyes, I think it would be fine to just find an excuse to off saffron. However, Codex the acolyte is extremely insistent on raising her to become the next sacred tree. She has undergone related education since she was a young girl, which would save a lot of work on our part. As for her identity as the daughter of rose myrtle... She is still young and has not yet grown wings. If we can just keep her grounded, the power of the divine oracle will remain tightly in our grasp. 

       We both know that the saffron's most outstanding property is that it can be cooked in so many ways: Put in porridge, stewed, or fried... No matter how you cook it, this plant will always be a delicacy.
