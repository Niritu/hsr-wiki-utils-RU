In Amphoreus, people employ many rituals to honor the world's cornerstone &mdash; the Pillar of Stone, Georios. One of the most important ceremonies is the mysterious Georios ritual performed annually in the city of Akashic. This ceremony comprises two parts: the Revival Ritual in the {{Rubi|Month of Cultivation|Fourth Month}} and the Harvest Ritual in the {{Rubi|Month of Reaping|Eighth Month}}.

Legend has it that in the advent of the Era Bellica, with the birth of death, caducity, sickness, and starvation also swept across the lands. In a bid for survival, humanity began their relentless exploitation of nature with their hunting and gathering. Enraged by this foolishness, Cerces meted divine punishment. Plants began to wither, and men, in desperation, fought one another like wild beasts for base domination. Georios deeply loved all creatures on the earth, implored Cerces to give humanity another chance &mdash; if they could overcome their own avarice, life would once again return to the lands.

Georios bade their mole follower to steal the last apple from the humans' bag, and led them to a golden wheat field. The masses saw food, and quickly trampled all over the field in their frenzied efforts to occupy it. Only a priest of Georios ignored the people's mockery, leaving behind a single handful of wheat seeds. He offered a prayer to the lands, and proceeded to plant them. This act placated Cerces' rage, allowing humanity to continue their existence.

The humans erected a temple to Georios over the place where the first handful of wheat seeds were planted, and built the city of Akashic around the temple. During the Month of Reaping, acolytes from all over would deliver their first handful of wheat to this temple &mdash; a token of gratitude to this great Titan.

It is said that when he buried the wheat seeds, that priest mimicked the act of a mole burrowing into the earth, to loosen up the soil and prepare it for cultivation. This is why, on the eighth day of the Revival Ritual during the Month of Cultivation, the moment when families experience the {{Rubi|Entry Hour|Dawn}}, they will go to the wild fields to gather a handful of soft dirt. After that, they will cleanse the soil of impurities, place them in a clay container and enshrine it in their homes &mdash; to pray for a bountiful harvest that year.

After that, with the help of others, the priest would dig up a pre-made clay effigy of Georios previously buried at an appointed spot. This was meant to symbolize the awakening of the Titan of Earth, so that all life could be revived and flourish once more. At the moment of the {{Rubi|Lucid Hour|Morning}}, people would gather at the city gate, and the procession would follow behind the dromas pulling the effigy along, all the way to the temple at the heart of the city, where they would perform prayers at the ritual.

And on the fourth day of the Harvest Ritual during the Month of Reaping, Georios disciples and priests from the cities across Amphoreus will gather in Akashic. When the {{Rubi|Action Hour|Noon}} reaches its first quarter, a grand harvest festival will be held at the temple's plaza, with participants singing, dancing, and feasting. This revelry will continue until the {{Rubi|Parting Hour|Evening}} reaches its fifth quarter. As the feast comes to a head, the priests will each hold a single ear of wheat, perform their prayers to the statue of Georios in the temple and offer the wheat to the altar. This is to symbolize the lesson of the past that should never be forgotten, as well as to give thanks to Georios' act of asking forgiveness on behalf of humanity from Cerces.
