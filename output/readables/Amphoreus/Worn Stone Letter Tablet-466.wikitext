'''██ ████ ██deimos,'''

       If this letter reaches you... it means ███████████ you've somehow made it through, my child. Two days ago, I found out about █████ ████ to ████ your life. But by then, you were already imprisoned, and even my frantic attempt to escape with you was too late. If I fail to convince your fath██ ██ ██████ ███ ██ ████████ tomorrow, I'll launch a ████ ██████ █████ ███ to save you from his grasp. I'm not fully confident of my chances... but as your mother, I'm prepared to █████████ my own life, even dragging ████ ███ ██ █ █████ with me into the depths of the River of Souls, if need be. When the throne stands vacant and chaos reigns in Kremnos, you can trust the ████ ███████ ███████ of Krateros. He's my chosen guardians. You █████ ███████ ██ █████ ██

       Mydeimos! Do not ██ ██ █████ ██ ██ forget me, █████ that despicable king. We once vowed to terminate the ██████████ ███████ ██ Kremnos in our era. Yet, along the journey, his greed and evil overwhelmed him, causing him to sacrifice even the honor of ███ ███ ██████. Mydeimos! Do not █████ ██ ██████ ███ ████ ███████

       Myd███████ █████ cry was so fragile and ethereal. ████ █ ██ █████, █████ ██ █ ████████ █████ could █ have imagined that such a faint sound would come from our child. But when Nikador's battle cry resonated through the Soul-Forging Gate, echoing the ███-███████ ████-████████ roar of the Tretos lion, there was no denying it: You are of pure Kremnoan blood, the son of ███ █████ █████ ██ ███████ {{Rubi|Gorgo|Founder of Kremnos}}!

       But Mydeimos... I'm afraid your journey ahead is ███████ ███ ████████ fraught with hardships. I never thought ██ █████ ███ ██████, nor will I ever accept ███ ████████ ██ take your life. Should that happen... you'd be orphaned, perhaps █████ ████ ██ ███████ ██ ████ ████ ███ forever branded with scars and blood.

       Mydeimos... If this must come to pass... As the son of ███ █████ █████ ██ ███████ {{Rubi|Gorgo|Founder of Kremnos}}, I foresee ████ ███ ████ █████████ ████, ███ you will grow with unwavering determination and claim the title of War Commander ████ ██ ████ ████████ ███ ████ ███████ ███ ██ ███████ ████. Forge ahead and do as your spirit guides you! Gorgo, the Founder of Kremnos, ███ █████ █████ ██ ███████, summoned Nikador and earned the glory of Strife. And you, my child, can return to the "Lance of Fury" with ████ ██████ ██████...

       My dear Mydeimos...

       Mydeimos...
