''Legend says the Chrysos Heir bard Illia once passed through Janusopolis during Fate Season, casually singing this folk song while riding a dromas.''

When the year is young and new, Janus bars their ancient door<br />
The eldest sister of Fate draws borders true, with chains across the cosmic floor<br />
See the lines that split the sky, cleaving future from the past<br />
All cast earthly bonds aside, and burn the bridges to their yore<br />
"When these gates swing wide again, new dawns shall rise once more"

In the month of perfect time, Talanton winds the springs of fate<br />
The second sister of Fate with measures fine, weighs all things both small and great<br />
See how dawn and dusk align, day and night in equal weight<br />
Mortals rise when dawn bells ring, rest when sunset takes its place<br />
"Perfect balance shows us all, nothing's truly small or great"

In the drowsiest of days, Oronyx spreads sleepy haze<br />
The youngest sister of Fate falls like ambrosia flows, muting reason's waking prose<br />
See how dim the daylight grows, even the Dawn Device drifts to repose<br />
Mortals drift in dreamy doze, melancholy softly flows<br />
"Let all rest in gentle peace, till new life brings sweet release"
