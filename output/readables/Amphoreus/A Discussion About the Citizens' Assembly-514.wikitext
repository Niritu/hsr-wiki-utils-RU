''*A recorded discussion between two Chrysos Heirs. Most are illegible, leaving only fragments of dialogue...*''


<div align="center">Phainon:<br />
''Aglaea, if the majority of the citizens' assembly votes against the ideals we're insisting on, what should we do?''


Aglaea:<br />
''I can guess what you're thinking. Let me ask you some questions &mdash; there are no right or wrong answers. You can take your time.''


Aglaea:<br />
''First question: Okhemans believe a decision made by many is more correct than a decision made by one person. Do you think that's true?''


Phainon:<br />
''I believe one person can consider only so many factors.''


Phainon:<br />
''A scholar once said, "A crowd gathered in one assembly becomes like some magnificent human with countless arms and eyes, together with many personalities and much wisdom."''


Phainon:<br />
''...But other scholars have stated how such a crowd can be controlled by mob mentality &mdash; the same thousand people who cheer for something as a crowd might completely reject it when split into smaller groups.''


Aglaea:<br />
''Second question: Do you think every citizen can truly understand the impact of the different decisions?''


Phainon:<br />
''...They cannot. Most state politics require a sophist to explain them.''


Aglaea:<br />
''Does that mean the public can easily be controlled by sophists?''


Aglaea:<br />
''Third question: Would the public be responsible for the results of their actions?''


Phainon:<br />
''To my knowledge, there was once a devastating military defeat in Okhema's history &mdash;''


Phainon:<br />
''When the news of the defeat reached the city, people flooded the streets in rage and accused the orators who advocated for this "expedition."''


Phainon:<br />
''However, the "expedition" was the result of a vote made by the public in the citizens' assembly...''


Aglaea:<br />
''With any topic, the citizens' assembly is not absolutely correct, does not have an absolute understanding, and takes no responsibility.''


Aglaea:<br />
''I believe you should not be troubled by its ultimate result, but focus on winning.''


Aglaea:<br />
''Fourth question: Do you believe that I will continue persisting in the Flame-Chase Journey, even if the public no longer supports it?''


Phainon:<br />
''I understand now. Thank you, Aglaea.''</div>
