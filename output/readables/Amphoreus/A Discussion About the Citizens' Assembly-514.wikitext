<br /><div align="center">Phainon:</div><br /><div align="center">''Aglaea, if the majority of the citizens' assembly votes against the ideals we're insisting on, what should we do?''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Aglaea:</div><br /><div align="center">''I can guess what you're thinking. Let me ask you some questions &mdash; there are no right or wrong answers. You can take your time.''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Aglaea:</div><br /><div align="center">''First question: Okhemans believe a decision made by many is more correct than a decision made by one person. Do you think that's true?''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Phainon:</div><br /><div align="center">''I believe one person can consider only so many factors.''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Phainon:</div><br /><div align="center">''A scholar once said, "A crowd gathered in one assembly becomes like some magnificent human with countless arms and eyes, together with many personalities and much wisdom."''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Phainon:</div><br /><div align="center">''...But other scholars have stated how such a crowd can be controlled by mob mentality &mdash; the same thousand people who cheer for something as a crowd might completely reject it when split into smaller groups.''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Aglaea:</div><br /><div align="center">''Second question: Do you think every citizen can truly understand the impact of the different decisions?''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Phainon:</div><br /><div align="center">''...They cannot. Most state politics require a sophist to explain them.''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Aglaea:</div><br /><div align="center">''Does that mean the public can easily be controlled by sophists?''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Aglaea:</div><br /><div align="center">''Third question: Would the public be responsible for the results of their actions?''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Phainon:</div><br /><div align="center">''To my knowledge, there was once a devastating military defeat in Okhema's history &mdash;''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Phainon:</div><br /><div align="center">''When the news of the defeat reached the city, people flooded the streets in rage and accused the orators who advocated for this "expedition."''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Phainon:</div><br /><div align="center">''However, the "expedition" was the result of a vote made by the public in the citizens' assembly...''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Aglaea:</div><br /><div align="center">''With any topic, the citizens' assembly is not absolutely correct, does not have an absolute understanding, and takes no responsibility.''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Aglaea:</div><br /><div align="center">''I believe you should not be troubled by its ultimate result, but focus on winning.''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Aglaea:</div><br /><div align="center">''Fourth question: Do you believe that I will continue persisting in the Flame-Chase Journey, even if the public no longer supports it?''</div>

<br /><div align="center">Phainon:</div><br /><div align="center">''I understand now. Thank you, Aglaea.''</div>
