''Oronyx's Revelation''

<div align="center">{{Size|28|Preamble}}</div><br />Dear disciples, when you open this book, you will embark on the first steps to understanding the mysteries of destiny. In this world shrouded by eternal night, though we may not lay eyes on the starry sky, Janusopolis' astrology arts passed down to us will be the bridge that connects us to the Titans' will.

Remember, true astrology is not mere inference of the celestial, but insight into the laws of how the world works, and perceiving the signs that the Titans left behind.

''*A line of crooked characters &mdash; from the ink's color, it appears to have been added in recent years: *''<br />''!!! Even in the Eternal City of Okhema, beneath the radiant shine of the Dawn Device, even if we will never witness the eternal night of Oronyx, we still endeavor to glimpse the trail of destiny through calculation and extrapolation!!!''

<div align="center">{{Size|28|Chapter 1: Twelve Heavenly Palaces and Titans}}</div><br />Before learning about astrology, you must familiarize yourself with the Twelve Heavenly Palaces and their respective Titans:<br />1. Dawn Palace &mdash; Aquila<br />2. Earth Palace &mdash; Georios<br />3. Tide Palace &mdash; Phagousa<br />4. Erudite Palace &mdash; Cerces<br />5. Omniscience Palace &mdash; Kephale<br />6. War Palace &mdash; Nikador<br />7. Evernight Palace &mdash; Oronyx<br />8. Justice Palace &mdash; Talanton<br />9. Gate Palace &mdash; Janus<br />10. Aunarch Palace &mdash; Mnestia<br />11. Trickery Palace &mdash; Zagreus<br />12. Death Palace &mdash; Thanatos<br />Each Palace represents the Titan's authority among their order, influencing all facets of the world. When we divine, we must calculate the positions and strengths of each Heavenly Palace to forecast how the Titan's will manifests.

<div align="center">{{Size|28|Chapter 2: Astrology Calculation}}</div><br />I know that our readers all hail from the Eternal City of Okhema &mdash; it is enveloped in the radiance of the Dawn Device, preventing us from witnessing the stars. Nonetheless, this does not mean that the art of astrology has lost its meaning. On the contrary, the Dawn Device's operational principle has provided us with a new foundation of calculation.

To perform astrology forecasts, we must first observe the Dawn Device's changes in light. Note down the brightest and dimmest moments in the light, for these two times indicate the changes in Aquila's authority. With these as fundamental references, we can forecast the positions of the other Heavenly Palaces.

For example, when the Dawn Device is at its brightest, the Dawn Palace's position is directly above.<br />At this moment: The Earth Palace is positioned east, Tide Palace is west, Evernight Palace is located directly below, and the other Heavenly Palaces are positioned in clockwise order.

''*No idea who wrote a note at the side: *''<br />''The Dawn Device's light changes... I can't see anything. Also, this is considered astrology?''<br />''You can't take this book's contents too seriously. Don't be misled by those devious disciples of Oronyx!!!''

<div align="center">{{Size|28|Chapter 3: Chart Mapping}}</div><br />After ascertaining the Heavenly Palaces' positions, the next step is to draw the chart. The chart is a circular diagram divided into twelve equal sections, each section representing a Heavenly Palace.

Mapping steps are as follows:<br />1. Draw a big circle representing the entire world.<br />2. Divide this circle into twelve equal sections.<br />3. Within each section, mark the corresponding Palace names and the Titans governing them.<br />4. Determine, according to the Dawn Device's changes in light, the exact positions of the Heavenly Palaces.<br />5. Draw a smaller circle at the center of the big circle, representing the divined individual.

Remember, the chart is not fixed, nor unchanging. With the passage of time, the positions of each Heavenly Palace will also change. This is why the precise recording of time is essential.

<div align="center">{{Size|28|Chapter 4: Interpreting the Titans' Influence}}</div><br />Once the mapping of the chart is complete, you can start to interpret the Titans' influence on us. Influence is largely dependent on two factors: the Heavenly Palaces' positions and the aspect relations between Heavenly Palaces.

[Positional Influence]<br />The influence of the Heavenly Palace in the east is strongest, symbolizing new life and ascendance.<br />The Heavenly Palace directly above represents the state of apex.<br />The influence of the Heavenly Palace in the west is weaker, representing decline.<br />The influence of the Heavenly Palace directly below is weakest, yet also hints at the possibility of concealment and rebirth.

[Aspect Relations]<br />Opposition: Two Heavenly Palaces are 180 degrees apart, representing conflict and opposition.<br />Trine: 120 degrees apart, representing harmony and complementarity.<br />Square: 90 degrees, representing anxiety and challenge.<br />Sextile: 60 degrees apart, representing opportunity and potential.

For example, if the Erudite Palace and War Palace form an opposition, it can be construed as a clash between reason and violence. And if the Erudite Palace and Omniscience Palace form a trine, it may mean that the powers of erudition and omniscience are harmonized &mdash; a grand opportunity to perform study and discovery.

<div align="center">{{Size|28|Chapter 5: Practice and Caution}}</div><br />As a beginner, you can start off with simple everyday divinations. For example, performing a reading at the Entry Hour to forecast the general direction of the day. During the Curtain-Fall Hour, review your astrological notes for the day to see if your results match the readings of the day's start. As you garner more experience, you can try to decipher more complicated aspects.

However, keep in mind that while astrology is powerful, it is not omnipotent. The will of the Titans is unfathomable, and our readings will forever be mere conjecture. Pray be always humble, never seeking to challenge the Titans' authority.

Additionally, be on guard against charlatans who proclaim themselves masters of destiny. True astrologers know that our duty is to interpret destiny, not to manipulate it.

Last but not least, may Oronyx's wisdom guide you.
