...The black tide may be an indescribable enemy, but if exploited carefully, it can also become a sharp weapon pointed at our archenemy.

Infiltrators can be instructed to transport a load of tainted Titankin covered in special earth, so that they may be smuggled among dromas caravan goods into Okhema. Upon entry, under the cover of the Curtain-Fall Hour, the personnel will stash the kin in various sections of the city. After a few days, the earth will weather and peel, suffocating the streets of Okhema with Titankin's tainted air.

When this moment arrives, the Okhemans will be frantically searching for the source of the pollution. We just have to wait for the chaos to unfurl to take the final step to victory: Gather the heroic souls within the city, let the divine blade of wrath point at Okhema, and run Strife's blade through the entire city &mdash; after which, our forces will overwhelm them like an ocean wave crashing into them, and the long-awaited victory will finally fall into our grasp.
