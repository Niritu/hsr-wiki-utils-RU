The Express suffered an attack from an unknown source, and we were forced to make an emergency stop at an unknown location. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries. Looking at the buildings in the surrounding area, we were able to make an initial inference that this world contained civilized life. While exploring a temple, we made first contact with the people of Amphoreus. They called themselves the Chrysos Heirs and were in the area to rescue refugees headed to the "holy city" of Okhema. The two Amphoreans were quite remarkable. The Chrysos Heir named Tribbie was able to use a mysterious power of space-time replication to repair buildings. The Chrysos Heir Phainon boasted remarkable martial arts prowess, breaking my lance with a single strike.

We rushed to the holy city with the refugees, but the Strife Titan "Nikador" happened to launch a surprise attack upon our arrival. The Titans are the Gods worshiped by the Amphoreans. It is currently unknown as to whether they have any relation to the Aeons. The Titankin of Nikador are extremely ferocious. With the situation looking dire, we offered our assistance to Phainon. We defeated every Titankin that stood in our paths, protected the citizens, and finally faced the body of Nikador alongside Phainon. Throughout this process, we came to meet Chrysos Heirs known as Mydei and Castorice. Mydei's martial arts skill was similar to that of Phainon, and Castorice was able to steal the life energy of others through touch.

It seemed that the Nikador that took part in this attack was just one of the many manifestations of the Strife Titan. Phainon was unable to obtain the crucial Coreflame that they spoke of. The leader of the Chrysos Heirs, Aglaea, took us to Marmoreal Palace and had the bath sprites tell us the history of Amphoreus. We learned that the Twelve Titans created Amphoreus, but that this world was now under threat of extermination. The Titans have lost their minds, and the Chrysos Heirs must defeat them one-by-one to light the Coreflames and save Amphoreus.

Aglaea also wields a remarkable ability... Her golden thread had the ability to read people's minds. She made a strange request of us: To not expose our identity as visitors from beyond the sky to the people of Okhema. The "holy city" of Okhema is the only place of eternal daytime in this world of apocalyptic night. We explored the city and came to learn of the local customs, as well as collecting reliable information. However, March 7th's picture was unexpectedly leaked. Not only did this lead to her being heralded as the "Rosy Celestial Maiden" by the Okheman citizenry, it almost led to a fatal mistake. However, we were able to rescue this citizen that was hell-bent on exploring the skies at the cost of exposing our identities as guests from beyond the sky. Unfortunately, this meant betraying our promise to Aglaea.

...

In the end, our luck ran out. The golden thread of Aglaea spreads across all of Okhema and news of these decisions eventually reached her ears. The leader of the Chrysos Heirs finally exposed her ruthless and unfeeling side, threatening our lives and asking us again why it was that we had come to Amphoreus. Though we passed her examination, our impression of Amphoreus had dropped considerably, and we even considered leaving for a new destination. However, as we followed Phainon and learned of the Chrysos Heirs' brutal journey ahead to save their world, we finally decided to remain in Amphoreus.

After some recovery, the Chrysos Heirs reconvened once more. They prepared to begin a crusade against Castrum Kremnos, the city in which Nikador was located, and steal the Coreflame of the "Lance of Fury." (Trailblazer), Phainon, and Mydei all came to Castrum Kremnos. The once war-obsessed city that used to be filled with the sounds of blade and battle had now become a gloomy wasteland. Now, the insane Nikador loomed somewhere in the depths of this moving fortress.

While exploring Castrum Kremnos, (Trailblazer) and the others learned that Nikador had long since hatched a plan for a terrible attack on Okhema. They successfully fought their way to Nikador. However, they unexpectedly discovered that the Titan that was once known for their glory had, at some point, forged themself an immortal body and was trying to wield the "Blade of Fury" to pierce Okhema from afar. In this moment of crisis, Mydei managed to restrain Nikador alone as the others returned to Okhema to discuss a way to foil Nikador's plans.

Castorice discovered that Nikador's immortal body came from their betrayal of "death." In order to break this riddle that had been long buried in time, we headed to the Temple of the Three Fates located in the Abyss and attempted to use the power of Oronyx to replicate the past. However, Oronyx did not seem to welcome us. In fact, they attempted to stop us from reaching the temple depths using various puzzles and challenges. Their final puzzle was: To find something heavier than the "World's Destiny." We were able to pass this test with the help of March 7th's camera and a little trickery.

However, although we made it to Oronyx's location, the Time Titan still refused to provide their assistance. Considering that time was running out to rescue Mydei, Phainon considered just killing the Titan and taking the Coreflame by force. Just as tensions were reaching a peak, Oronyx's attitude seemed to change when they laid eyes on (Trailblazer). According to (Trailblazer), Oronyx showed {{MC|f=her|m=him}} a memory of the Stellaron Hunters... It was a memory that logically should not exist, yet it was extremely vivid. Inside this nonexistent memory, (Trailblazer) happened to catch the gaze of the Aeon of Remembrance, Fuli. Perhaps it was a gift from Oronyx, but at this moment a mysterious creature named Mem appeared at {{MC|f=her|m=his}} side. Though {{MC|f=she|m=he}} suddenly seemed to grow... somber, {{MC|f=she|m=he}} fortunately snapped out of it quickly.

Having returned from the Abyss, we split up once again. Phainon and I went on to assist Mydei in their long-fought battle to the death. (Trailblazer), on the other hand, used the power gifted to them by Oronyx to collect memory fragments and find a way to visit the Castrum Kremnos of the past. With Castorice by their side, they would find a way to undo Nikador's immortality. At the same time, Aglaea was getting to work in Okhema dealing with Nikador's infiltration.

Having collected the memory fragments and successfully opened the gate to Castrum Kremnos' past, (Trailblazer) arrived in the ancient city. When they arrived, they discovered that the Kremnos Festival was in full swing and Nikador's descent into madness was just beginning. The city was yet still lively, bustling. In order to ensure the success of their plan, Castorice and (Trailblazer) decided to blend in with the festival and ended up forming a three-man team with a taciturn gladiator named Gnaeus before heading deep into the city. Collecting intel as they advanced, they vowed to restore Nikador's fractured mind, stop the birth of their immortal body and restore the honor of the Strife Titan. What no one expected was that Gnaeus was actually a part of Nikador. Having learned of the suffering that awaits in the future, he fearlessly allowed himself to be integrated into Nikador's corrupted soul and made them whole again. Though we were able to undo their immortality, this also meant that the Titan stood before us in their ultimate form.

After a grueling battle, the "Lance of Fury" Nikador came to an end at the hands of a Chrysos Heir victory. After returning to Okhema and taking some time to recover, we witnessed the return of the Coreflame of Nikador. Phainon bid us a brief farewell before entering the Vortex of Genesis to undergo the trial of the Strife Titan's Coreflame. Through this trial, Phainon would obtain the powers of a demigod, while taking on the role of the corresponding Titan. I wish him success in this endeavor.
