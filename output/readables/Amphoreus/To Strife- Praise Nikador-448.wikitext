''Before a campaign, Kremnoan citizens will organize a blood ritual, igniting Nikador's might with slaughter, singing hymns over the wails of the sacrificial tribute.''

The Undefeated, Overlord of Battlefields, King of Castrum Kremnos and the Ruins,<br />Grand Artisan of Chariots, the Throne of Corpses, Father of Victory,<br />The Usurper, lightning that shatters earth and seas, Guardian of Amphoreus,<br />Strife Titan, Lance of Fury, Nikador.

Commander to whom the world should bow, the eternally edged weapon, the law of Strife and that which severs strife.<br />Praise Nikador, the greatest conqueror, the greatest protector.<br />You are the usurper of all defeated, solely bearing the world's wounds on your back.

You were once the lightning spear of the firmament, the worldsplitting spine.<br />Hewing of the River of Souls, survivors unto dead waters.<br />Unceasing flames of war, pyre of high graves.<br />The sky-piercing lance, the ruination of night and light.

The vanquished behold woe, glory to all honorable dead, the fallen feeds my might.<br />Fury falls, and all bows to Strife &mdash;<br />Sentinels who stand fast between the skies and earth, repel the enemy hordes and safeguard the peace of the myriad cities!<br />Calamity Eternal casting devastation on myriad cities, turning foes to ash!
