'''To my dearest wife:'''

       Though I miss you dearly, I feel as if you were by my side as I read your letters.

       There have been no major developments in the Grove lately. All research is advancing as projected and we have no major concerns. I have been eating, sleeping, and living well. Fear not.

       Though I do have one interesting story: the sisters Artakama and Cynane have taken to challenging me to battle in their spare time. What kind of Grove scholar would resort to the logic of fists over academia under the watchful eye of Cerces? What I did not expect was that these two actually have some skills! I hear that they possessed quite the arrogant temperament when they were young and often got into fights with neighboring children... You must not tell anyone that I told you this. I am so grateful that you taught me martial arts, otherwise, news of them beating me to the ground would have already spread across Okhema.

       I also wanted to ask. Does the clothes that I sent to you last time still fit? The Lotophagists are making remarkable strides in their research and have recently developed a number of new fabrics from plant fibre. Their newest fabrics are stain-resistant while still being soft to the touch. There are a few tailors in the Grove who have some skills. I have asked them to put together a few outfits for you. Though I know you have no interest in extravagant clothing, the lace design on these items is a personal preference of mine. I'm certain you'd look wonderful in them... I hope you can forgive my selfishness.

       It has been three years and seven months since I took up my post in the Grove, and eight whole years since the day we met. With our anniversary next month, I will apply for leave with my colleagues and return to Okhema to spend a few days with you. I know you have many affairs to tend to. Make sure to rest and do not put yourself under excess mental or physical strain. May Nikador protect you.

       Take care, my dearest wife!
