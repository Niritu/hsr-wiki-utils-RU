On Duty: Alex<br />
Shift: Night<br />
Work Details: Planting charges<br />
Remarks: The charges have all been planted, remember to let the technician check them tomorrow. It's a little hard to see in the dark. By the way, is anyone planning to check out the new Fight Club after work?

On Duty: Andre<br />
Shift: Day<br />
Work Details: Blasting<br />
Remarks: One of the detonators broke, but luckily, nothing happened, or we would all be blown to kingdom come. As a side note, Alex, stop thinking about nonsense all day long. It was nearly over for me because of you.

On Duty: Alex<br />
