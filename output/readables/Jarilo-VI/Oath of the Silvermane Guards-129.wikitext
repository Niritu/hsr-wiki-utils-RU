==Text==
As a child of Belobog and the executor of the will of the Supreme Guardian, I volunteer to join the Belobog Silvermane Guards.<br />
In the name of the glory of the Silvermane Guards, I hereby swear under the city wall:

I will constantly protect the last bastion of humanity &mdash; Belobog<br />
I will be loyal to Belobog, the Architects, and the citizens<br />
I will carry myself with courage, justice, selflessness, and loyalty

I will obey the laws of the Guards<br />
I will remember the oath of the Guards<br />
I will obey the command of the Guardian<br />
I will uphold the honor of the Architects<br />
For every step I take forward, it is tomorrow.<br />
For every time I stand still, it is our formation line.<br />
For every time I step back, it is home

This oath shall stand for as long as the wall stands<br />
Should I break the solemn vow<br />
I will offer myself to be judged and punished by the Belobog laws, the Supreme Guardian, and all citizens.
