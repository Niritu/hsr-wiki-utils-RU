<div align="center">''*A shabby handwritten flyer. You can feel the writer's effort as the paper has been penetrated at several characters, but you can still read it.*''

Boulder Town residents<br />
When you receive this flyer,<br />
you should know that the fissure is now corroding our home. <br />In the past, we had Silvermane Guards repelling invading monsters at the front line.<br />
However, with an order, the soldiers have been sent away to the distant battle field.<br />
They never come back.

Without protection from the Silvermane Guards, we saw the tragedy of the Rivet Town.<br />
Some escaped to the Boulder Town, struggling for a new life.<br />
Some went into the mines, living a homeless life.<br />
But are those misfortunes fated?

Of course not!

Pick up your pickaxes, take your explosions.<br />
We know that the fissure's corrosion never stops. We know that monsters are running towards us.<br />
Stop daydreaming about when the Silvermane Guards would return. We can protect ourselves!<br />
This is our belief, Wildfire's belief.

Wildfire not only want warriors.<br />
We want more people to stand together and maintain the city's order from collapsing.<br />
We also need more people to contribute to scientific medical aids.<br />
We also want more people to discuss the future of the Underworld.<br />
We look forward to your participation.

Join Us<br />
You can ask any Wildfire member you see in the Underworld about how to join us.
