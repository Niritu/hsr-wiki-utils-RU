===Pilgrimage North of Snowfield===
I had once gazed toward the snowcapped peak

Frosty springs had yet flow into the prologue<br />
But appear skybound the eyes of others in the dark hours<br />
Clouds enveloped the mason in the village<br />
And travelers peer into the Amber's past

The journey of my heart<br />
Is the pilgrimage of my soul

I had once gazed toward the snowcapped peak

In the days boreas borrowed my singing voice<br />
The land and the birds will all fall silent<br />
You will see the spine of the world on the mining veins<br />
Above the stars and below the bonfire wood<br />
Forging memories in the name of the blacksmith<br />
Given meaning by the supreme fire

I dig burrows, and you build walls<br />
I dig burrows, and you build walls<br />
And one day the walls will fall<br />
And one day the tears will fall<br />
The end is etched into the distant plains<br />
Waiting for this poem to die<br />
Till the snowcapped peaks close their eyes<br />
Or the flowers fall

===Dusk in Rivet Town===
I am jealous of the gear that lost the dusk<br />
The turning days never had a future<br />
Three shields per bottle<br />
The retail sale of souls<br />
Just enough for one mouthful in a meal

Amber, amber, yet another amber for enrichment<br />
The stars in the hometown are never on time<br />
Wind, wind, another wind howls as a hawk<br />
The evening light tolls<br />
And takes away the stone pier with nowhere to go in Rivet Town

Shackles applied, on a moist heart<br />
How could it be measured in kilograms<br />
Yet another stone statue stands at the start of the mine shaft<br />
The mining machines sculpt the pattern of its own trousers<br />
Passersby all say<br />
It's so foolish

===Chubby Larry===
Chubby Larry walking one step every three seconds <br />To cross his brown kingdom <br />Past the <br />Forty centimeters of mine cart <br />Past the <br />Festival that lasts from winter to summer

Qlipoth had said <br />We should build his temple with love <br />But humans only ever offered rocks and words

Qlipoth had been here <br />And gave him a sexy pickaxe <br />He thought it was a secret <br />He always faced the night deep in the mines, and shouted with his arms up high <br />Chubby Larry! <br />He thought he probably wasn't young anymore <br />Fifty years of song <br />Sealed away his arms like a mine collapse

Larry of the Broken-Arms! <br />He embraced the winter like a rock crab and roared <br />He walked past the silent beach of broken rocks with his draft <br />His boss always scolded him <br />With a ring of glory! With the clouds!

Lazy Larry! <br />He stared at the funeral worm at the corner <br />And cried in front of them, alone <br />Larry the Crybaby! <br />People no longer needed his stories <br />Using the wanted poster of poverty as silver threads, they sewed his mouth shut

Sorrowful Larry! <br />But he could still hear <br />The breaths of flowing ores and the running steps of words <br />Sorrowful Larry had to live in a portable coffin <br />Taking out his sincere pickaxe <br />Folding it into the form of birds he had never seen <br />And flipped backward twice in overcritical degrees

Mute Larry! <br />Weaving lyrics in the caves all on his own <br />He ate seventeen, Soothing Mushrooms <br />He said, "Wake me!" <br />And seventeen poets slapped his face

They say, Larry was no more! <br />Larry had nothing and crossed the Great Mine <br />Like an iron pickaxe, he was buried in the earth

The passersby never saw this <br />They just say <br />A chubby man fell asleep
