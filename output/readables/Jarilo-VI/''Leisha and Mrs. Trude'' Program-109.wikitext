<div align="center">When Stories Become Truth: Re-Discovering Childhood in ''Leisha and Mrs. Trude''<br />
Author: Olsen, journalist of ''Belobog Weekly''</div>

Countless Belobog residents grew up with fairytales. However, while ordinary adults would gradually bid their childhood farewell with age, musical lovers got a chance to return to their childhood. On April 8, the musical ''Leisha and Mrs. Trude'' adopted from the classical fairytale will re-open at the Golden Theater.

The special charm of musicals made every corner of the theater fill with supernatural fairy tale beauty the moment ''Leisha and Mrs. Trude'' started. The traditional sing-and-dance format of musicals were broken in this two-hour music extravaganza. To suit the tastes of younger audiences, the performers stood on stilts and had puppet shows. These adjustments were very effective &mdash; in ''Belobog Weekly&ast;''s annual Best Musical Award this year, ''Leisha and Mrs. Trude'' won the Young Adult's Choice by a wide margin.

"This is a unique experience merging stories together with reality. I have three children and they're not all around the same age. The oldest is fourteen and the youngest is only six, but they all think this show was amazing. Now they finally have something in common to talk about." A parent stated this excitedly when we found them sitting outside the theater in a foldable chair, waiting for tickets to go on sale.

According to the education report released by the Ministry of Education of Belobog, ''Leisha and Mrs. Trude'' was the most popular children's story in Belobog in the past thirty years. Kyle, the show's director, told us that the musical contains many magnificent and creative backdrops and sets that are inspired by the children's story. At the same time, every song is longer than the average musical number. "It's because we need to demonstrate the details of the fairytale forest during every song, and we need to make every animal character come to life."

In the two-hour fairytale journey of ''Leisha and Mrs. Trude'', the audience can sing with the actors under the spotlight, and can also have unique interactions with the fantastic animals in the fairytale forest on stage. Leisha's innocent beauty, Mrs. Trude's loneliness and wondrous magic, and the unique personalities of the three knights were all expressed in the easter eggs in the encore, designed meticulously by Director Kyle and the stage crew. Those who like fairytales need to remember to stay till the very end for the encore!
