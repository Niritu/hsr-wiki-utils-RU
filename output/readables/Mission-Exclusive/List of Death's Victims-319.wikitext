:
''Note: It seems the culprit can ignore physical barriers. Conventional investigation methods feasible?''

:<br />Caixia, a female foxian, was engulfed by an unknown meme while playing Dreamy Slots in Golden Hour. The incident caused a huge commotion at the spot. The memories of most witnesses have been processed.

:
''Note: Abducted? Keep a lookout for this fervent fan.''

:<br />Marlowe, a male human, disappeared after being involved in a car accident in Golden Hour. Witnesses reported the presence of an eerie meme who fled underground at the scene of the accident.
