===Bereaved Letter===
:Dear Mr. Carefree:
:<br />I never thought that you'd write me a letter after all these millennia. I am deeply moved.
:<br />I'm afraid you may not know that the advisory letter you replied to was written by my grandfather. Back then, he was in a deep trouble and impatient, seeking advice from you on a way out &mdash; but he never got that reply. In the end, grandpa could not confront his demons and was struck by mara, so he ran out on me and our whole family. After that, we managed to pay back all of his old debts. We have finally lived up to our family name.
:<br />Time flies, and nearly three millennia have passed since then. We no longer torture ourselves with wondering about his changing moods back then, or how he came to such a plight. Reading your letter today has helped me realize that you are not the same person you were three millennia ago, and it's a pity. Thinking things through, it's probably because everyone in my world is hopeless at bearing this pain of infinitude.
:<br />There's too much to say in such a hasty reply. Please take good care of yourself.
