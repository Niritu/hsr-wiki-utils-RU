===Case Review (II)===
:Sparkle arrived at a clothes shop to purchase a tie, but was killed in the changing room. The police had determined that only three people could have killed Sparkle at the time &mdash; Wright the Pepeshi staff, Zhongshan the foxian gambler, and Lefton the Intellitron mogul.
:<br />Wright was often mocked by Sparkle due to their short stature. Zhongshang had once lost to Sparkle in a gamble and had to give her their family heirloom. And lastly, Lefton was Sparkle's biggest commercial competitor.
:<br />All three of them have sufficient motives. Who exactly was Sparkle's murderer?
