===Mei's Notes===
:''*Judging by the crumpled and detached state of the paper, it has been read over and over.*''
:<br />Note:
:<br />Need to hang Ms. Luhui's clothes under the sun once in a while.
:<br />Need to obtain her consent before hanging clothes that have not been worn for a long time under the sun.
:<br />Be careful not to wash or hang the red dress that has not been worn for a long time under the sun.
:<br />Ms. Luhui said that that dress can only be sent to the Cloudbreadth Sleeves for cleaning, and that she isn't confident about me washing that dress.
:<br />I need to use the contact number left by Ms. Luhui to contact the Cloudbreadth Sleeves:
:<br />6983144**********
:<br />The red dress is for important occasions like press conferences. After cleaning it and taking it home, remember to put it with mothproof incense wood.
:<br />Ms. Luhui has a lot of clothes that she will never wear again but is reluctant to throw away. Those clothes need to be packed and stored in boxes.
:<br />Don't throw away something she won't wear in front of her face, or she'll get upset.
