===Kluzer's Letter===
:Olga,
:<br />How has our son been? I hope his illness has gotten better.
:<br />My symptoms are still worsening. So, for safety concerns, we still can't see each other for the time being.
:<br />I've found a job that should be able to keep our family afloat.
:<br />I've always been sturdier than others, ever since I was a child. Even when I become sick, I'm still strong. So, no need to worry about me.
:<br />Take good care of yourself and our kid.
