:<br />She invited Julian, Luka, and {{MC|ж=Big Sister|м=Big Brother}} who always plays with them &mdash; and stuck a paper flower in each one's hair. There are four flowers &mdash; two white, two purple &mdash; and nobody (including Hook) looked at their own flower nor anybody else's flower.
:<br />Then, she arranged everyone to stand in a row facing forward. From the front, Hook, Julian, Luka, and {{MC|ж=Big Sister|м=Big Brother}} stood in that order.
