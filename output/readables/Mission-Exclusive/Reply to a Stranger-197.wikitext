:(Esteemed Stranger:
:
I hereby offer my most sincere apologies for my impertinence in not responding to your kind letter in a timely fashion. I only recently learned of your predicament. Words simply fail to encapsulate my deep/Pitiful Stranger:
:
After learning what you went through, I'm overwhelmed with deep)( sorrow. 'Tis why I've decided, if I may be so bold, to offer my/ apprehension. I shall in this letter offer my)( humble opinions on this matter, which I hope could serve you well. It'd be wise to/ wise advice for you to heed. You should)( come clean with your family about everything. Seek help from them, plan ahead with them, and together work your way out of the debts. Debt evasion may bring you a brief moment of relief, but it won't grant you lasting peace. Escaping from your liabilities will only cost you dearly once they catch up with you, and believe me, they will. You can't be on the run forever, and you will have to pay the price one way or another./ sever all ties with Xianzhou and then make a run for it as far away as possible. This way, you won't be troubled by however many debts you may owe. Let them all be gone with the wind!)
