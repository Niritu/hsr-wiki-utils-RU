:To the new generation of Nameless,
:<br />By the time you read this, I will likely have gone to where Mikhail went.
:<br />Thank you for everything you have contributed to Penacony. It's a pity that I won't be able to witness its rebirth with my own eyes, but your unwavering determination gives me confidence in the future of the Planet of Festivities.
:<br />Also, please say sorry to my naughty pet "Sleepie" on my behalf. It suffers from severe separation anxiety, and it must feel terribly lonely without me. Please release it into the Memory Zone, as that's where a meme truly belongs.
:<br />Life and death are merely parts of the fiction on the road of Enigmata, just like farewells and reunions.
:I wish you the very best in your future journey. As for me, it's time to depart.
:Enclosed is a gift for you.
:To the imperfect tomorrow.
