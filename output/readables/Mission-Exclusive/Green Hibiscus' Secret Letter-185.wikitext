===Green Hibiscus' Secret Letter===
:Gray Peony,
:You've fully demonstrated your bravery and devotion to us.
:I'll now give you a chance to prove how loyal and reliable you are to the organization.
:This mission is of utmost importance, and I don't feel comfortable entrusting it to others. Only a fighter like you can handle such an important task.
:Yesterday, a disciple absconded in disgrace. She posted a letter as she defected.
:Based on our investigation, it's an urgent missive to the Seat of Divine Foresight.
:It shouldn't have arrived yet. Intercept it, and help us mitigate our losses.
:Once you finish this arduous yet glorious task, I will introduce you to the Exalting Sanctum's leader of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.
:So long as he assents, you can begin your journey on the way of immortality.
