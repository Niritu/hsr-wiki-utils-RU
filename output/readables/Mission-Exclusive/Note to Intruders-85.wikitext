===Note to Intruders===
:You, don't move.
:When you find this note, you've already entered the surveillance zone of my Sky-Eye system.
:In other words, your exploration operation, which you thought went undetected, has been noted down by me.
:I've gone through the trouble of triple-encrypting this chamber just to lock the boring past within it.
:I can't just let you go now that you've discovered the big secret about my lineage.
:You inhaled the hallucinogenic poisonous gas as soon as you entered the room.
:The gas is so deadly that even the space station's greatest doctors are powerless to save you...
:In a nutshell, you're dead!
:<br />Ha! Is this joke making you shiver? You shouldn't have just barged into someone's private property.
:Okay, okay, there is no "Sky-Eye" or deadly gas.
:This room, on the other hand, is loaded with ancient and rare artifacts, none of which I want.
:You can take whatever you want as a reward for breaking the triple encryption.
:That's right, I prefer to reward rather than punish when it comes to running the space station&mdash;
:Encouraging you in your adventures and pursuit of knowledge.
:Thank me!
:<br />Don't forget to put away the things you messed up, get the reward you want, and leave.
:Don't hang around, and don't be greedy. Otherwise, I'm not sure what I'd do if I became angry.
