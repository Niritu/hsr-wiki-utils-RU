:<br />After many Amber Eras of chaos and war, Penacony decided to take its first step towards expanding the Dreamscape: The great architect Glaux arrived at Penacony following an invitation and began the search for a method to stabilize the Dreamscape alongside fellow architects.
:
It was at this moment that Penacony entered an age of rapid development historically known as the "Dreamchaser Era."
:<br />The "Dreamweaver Project" attracted outstanding talents from all across the Cosmos. Early Dreamweavers came from all different walks of life. They gathered together in the Nightingale Family and formulated countless wonderful concepts for the construction of the Dreamscape. The Nightingale Family head, Glaux, led the most talented and brilliant Dreamweavers among them to design and build the prototype of the 12 Dreamscapes of today. These Dreamweavers were known as the "Origami Dreamweavers." Their creations remain in the Penacony Dreamscape to this day.
