===The Scholars' Debates (I)===
:''*A recorded debate between Venerationist and Nousporist scholars. Most of it is illegible, leaving only fragments of dialogue...*''

''...We all recall that state that dared touch the sky. But what were they really? Just blind masses manipulated by ambitious politicians who dared challenge the Titans' authority.''

Venerationist Scholar:
:
''A completely meaningless attempt, an absolute mistake.''

Nousporist Scholar:
:
''Hmph, you Venerationists have bowed to the Titans for so long, you've forgotten a scholar's true purpose?''
:<br />
Nousporist Scholar:
:
''"Making a mistake does not mean the act was meaningless."''
:<br />
Nousporist Scholar:
:
''Even those students new to the Grove understand this from basic logic lessons.''
:<br />
Nousporist Scholar:
:
''An entire city-state reduced to ashes proved the skyships' construction was a mistake. To me, that's precisely the meaning they achieved through sacrifice.''

Venerationist Scholar:
:
''Am I hearing this right? Such a statement... are you converting to Venerationism?''
:<br />
Nousporist Scholar:
:
''No, I'm simply examining the matter from another perspective.''

''When we stand normally, the sky is above. When we stand on our heads, it's below our feet.''

Euthyphro:
:
''Heh, I don't even want to know what kind of situation inspired you to make such exalted theories.''

Euthyphro:
:
''By the way, I have a student who loves to write satirical comedies and once wrote about a fool who could not figure out a question no matter what.''

''As I said, there's no reasoning with you Venerationists.''

''You're like dromases, huge yet always gazing downward at the earth, while I want to be the wasp that stings the dromas.''
