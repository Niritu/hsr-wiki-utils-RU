===Aeons Overview===
:
:People know very little about the mysterious existence that dwells in the vast stellar seas. With the limitation of knowledge, intelligent lifeforms can only faintly discern that Aeons tread upon paths imperceptible to mortal beings and execute unfathomable powers via some form of belief. In the end, the Aeons became an embodiment of highly condensed concepts of philosophy through the word of mouth spread of their legends.
:<br />If anyone finds themselves treading on the Path of an Aeon, they will be inundated by a distant sensation, like being struck by a gaze from light-years across the cosmos. Many believe that this is the only connection the Aeons and mortals can ever have.

===The Destruction &mdash; Nanook===
:''{{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"If the increase of entropy is a fundamental law of the universe, then the heat death would be the inescapable destiny of the material world. So, why is it that we bother to struggle to survive? Expansion, fusion, and then annihilation. If we wish to welcome the new, then we must first embrace the end."
:<div align="right">&mdash; From a scientist just before pressing the button for nuclear detonation, 2152 AE</div>}}''
:<br />The birth of the universe is a mistake. If civilization is a cancer emerging quietly from the boundless stars, then war is the only common language known to all intelligent life.

To correct this mistake and to clean up this tainted universe, Nanook became the avatar of entropy.

===The Hunt &mdash; Lan===

===The Nihility &mdash; IX===
:''{{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"You may gaze deep into the vast grandeur of the stars, but do not glance at the abyss of the void... for it holds nothing except for the ability to make mortals lose all reason and thought."
:<div align="right">&mdash; Murong, Doctor of Chaos</div>}}''
:<br />The existence of Nihility is a mystery itself, THEIR form enshrouded by layers of mist.

===The Abundance &mdash; Yaoshi===
:{{Color|keyword|nobold=1|''"The flowers share their petals without care, waiting for their inevitable withering destiny. The birds fly high in song, moving toward their inevitable crash and death. The streams flow rapidly with life, in a direction where they inevitably run dry. Why must all things come to an end? There must be a miracle somewhere in the universe that can cure the disease known as finality."''

===The Elation &mdash; Aha===
:''{{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"The Erudition is a hunk of junk, the Preservation is a fool, the Hunt has no sense of humor, and the Destruction is a lunatic. All the Aeons are as stubborn as they come. What a shame for Aha!"
:<div align="right">&mdash; A Masked Fool who is a self-proclaimed astronomy expert</div>}}''
:<br />To savor joy is a privilege unique to sentient beings. Neither the dusty rocks nor the distant stars can fathom the humor that life entails.

Go chase laughter that leaves you breathless, twists born of fate's whimsy, and songs that ascend your soul.

===The Beauty &mdash; Idrila===
:{{Color|keyword|nobold=1|''"There is beauty in a stretch of fabric, in the lines of a poem, and in a few notes in a song &mdash; Welcome to an era where the idea of 'beauty' is absolutely worthless! How vulgar! How hopeless! How sad!"''
:<div align="right">&mdash; Fashion Guide of the Cosmos ''Chief Editor, Micheline von Tarantino''</div>}}

===The Enigmata &mdash; Mythus===
:''{{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"To stop questioning is to ask pouring rain to relinquish its faith in the glittering stars. Open yourself to the roaring river of metaphors, and you will find truth awaits, hiding at the end of the night sky, in the swirling rosy storm of a bygone age."
:<div align="right">&mdash;Sharon Leighton, Galactic Laureate Poet (Self-Proclaimed)</div>}}''
:<br />It is a fallacy that all things can be experienced and recognized. The living seek to produce prophecies of the unknown based on their limited grasp of order, but little do they know that the universe has no end and that the truth is but a fevered dream.
:<br />To prevent the certainty that Erudition brought about from destroying the possibilities championed by Mythus, Mythus conjured the Fog of Thought and the Rain of Sensation to reveal to the mortals the inexplicable truth through the four agents: Morph, Screen, Riddle, and Mirage.
