===Note Left by Luocha===
:Dear Nameless,
:<br />Having to deliver this letter instead of bidding you farewell in person on the Express leaves me with a sense of regret.
:<br />I've heard of your noble deeds in the Xianzhou Luofu and had the pleasure of getting to know such intriguing a friend as Dan Heng. This journey through the meandering Xianzhou has allowed each of us, including those on the Astral Express, to find what we were seeking â€“ a remarkable and fulfilling conclusion that is truly incredible. Now, I must continue on to the next station of my destiny.
:<br />In accordance with the customs of my homeland, it is customary to leave behind some tokens at the places one visits as a way to express gratitude to those who have aided in stepping onto unfamiliar ground and to wish for smooth travels ahead.
:<br />Thus, enclosed with this letter is a small token of appreciation. Please accept it with my sincere regards. May our paths cross once more in the future.
