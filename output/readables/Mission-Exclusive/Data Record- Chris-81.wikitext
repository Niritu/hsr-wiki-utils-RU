:
&mdash;sent a message saying, "It's ridiculous that any student would spend so much money on bed sheets. Is it proper for you to flaunt your money as a student?"

:
&mdash;sent a message replying to Stabbing Maniac, "Oh, I don't think the spaceship is that important. Isn't a month's living expenses of 4000 credits enough for two people? As a student, my monthly living expenses were only 500 credits, and I was perfectly content eating frozen, dried vegetables. You should be satisfied after spending so many years in education. It is extremely shallow to constantly encourage materialism. Please don't let your cynicism taint the OP."

&mdash;sent a message saying, "Just because you can't live on a tight budget doesn't mean others can't. Studying can be a joyful experience, and I can survive on water and compressed biscuits."
