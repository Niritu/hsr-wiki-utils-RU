===Letter from the Phantom Thief Cipher (Continued)===
:Dear Princess Homebody and Gray Mystery:
:<br />You probably guessed already &mdash; I had no intention of showing up at the pack beast workshop. This means, of course, I had no plans to return the gift there either... This was just a warm-up for our little game of cat and mouse.
:<br />But surely you've realized that the Kitty Phantom Thief never cared about *stealing a mere trinket*, right?
:<br />&mdash; No, what I'm really after is your hearts.
:<br />Just kidding.
:<br />I have no interest in your hearts. If Princess Homebody can track my path, then by all means try. I'll be waiting at the end. And rest assured, we'll meet face-to-face this time.
:<br />P.S. Gray Mystery, where did you get that Dew of Divine Blood? Don't tell me it's a gift from the seamstress? I'll taste it for you.
:<br /><div align="right">Sincerely, Kitty Phantom Thief</div>
