===Letter from the Phantom Thief Cipher (Continued Again)===
:Gray Mystery:
:<br />These formal addresses at the start of letters are such a hassle, and you've already read three useless phantom thief letters.
:<br />I've left Princess Homebody's gift here &mdash; take good care of it.
:<br />Remember, skip the baths and come straight to Okhema's city gate to find me.
:<br />You know I have no patience. Come late and I'll leave without you, clear?
:<br />P.S. Yes, I'm the one who tucked you in &mdash; you're welcome.
