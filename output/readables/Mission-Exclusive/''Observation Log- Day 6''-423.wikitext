:Though extremely rare, the observed subject has started to provide short answers for some simple questions, even though her cognition is still in a chaotic state.
:From what has been observed so far, she is not incapable of composing long and complex sentences. However... An unbearably intense pain would immediately attack her with high frequency, enough to interrupt her thoughts or even render her temporarily unconscious.
:<s>The relevant information should be delivered to Madam Ruan Mei, for her to decide whether the observed subject's senses should be temporarily numbed before conducting a questioning.</s>
:Correction: We have temporarily blocked the subject's various senses and are trying as much as we can to alleviate their pain. No further questioning will be made until the body's repair has made some progress.
