:'''Simulated Universe:''' You are stopped by an IPC vending machine in the ruins of the Kingdom of Banditry. It does not have eyes, but you are certain that this vending machine is looking at you with a lonely, miserable, and piteous gaze right at this very moment.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' As the only salesperson in the Talia region, it ranks at the very bottom of the sales department's charts because of its negative sales volume all year. There is only one reason for this: The customers here never pay when they buy anything.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Please buy something. If I don't up my performance, I'll be fired from the IPC. I have a smart refrigerator and a robot vacuum to feed at home." It sounds so upset that you almost suspect there's a real person hiding in the vending machine.

:{{DIcon|Star}} Buy everything in this vending machine! &mdash; Spend 300 Cosmic Fragments and purchase 2 random Equation(s) of 1- to 2-star rarity, with a 50% chance to additionally obtain 1 Equation(s)
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "Oh, you're like a second parent to me!" You decline the vending machine's praise, not wanting to add a strange vending machine to your family tree.
