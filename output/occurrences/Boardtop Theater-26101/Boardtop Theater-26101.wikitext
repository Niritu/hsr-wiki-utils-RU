==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You find yourself on a strange chessboard. Two hazy figures sway above, throwing out wooden sticks from their hands in order, and moving your position. Your body is round and smooth, just like... a Cyclicality chesspiece.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The Fate Titans' disciples model their actions after yours, emulating the change between life and reincarnation.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You leap quickly across the chessboard, from the snow-laden northern domain to the center of the Chrysos War. You begin to question the role you are playing. Meanwhile, another chesspiece stands at the other end of the battlefield. Oh, you're both now generals of two opposing city-states, about to engage in an intense battle!
