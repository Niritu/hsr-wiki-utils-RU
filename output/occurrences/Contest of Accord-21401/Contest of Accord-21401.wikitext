{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Beneath the neon lights of the underground boxing arena, high walls gradually rise up out of the enclosure as some two hundred Dahdah teams from all over the cosmos toss a pink ball in their hands, eager to give things a whirl.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Among the Candelagraphos' records, this sport remains second only to the Isthmian Confederation's angry cricket matches in terms of danger.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Abiding by the spirit of valuing peace, the almighty Laughter created Dahdah ball." Pinching her nose, the person on the loudspeaker says, "It uses ball collisions in lieu of physical clashes. Every player gets to have fun."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "There's only one rule: Knock out all competitors on the field with the ball to win!" With a whistle, several pink dahdah balls fly straight towards your face.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Pull out the baseball bat. &mdash; Enters a point-based battle lasting 2 Cycle(s). After achieving victory, obtain Cosmic Fragments equal to the amount of points obtained.
