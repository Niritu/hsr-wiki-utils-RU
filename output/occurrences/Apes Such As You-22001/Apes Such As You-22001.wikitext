{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You find a young ape lounging lazily on a rock. Its dense fur soaks in sunlight and sways in the wind like waves on a grassy plain.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The ape leisurely rolls over, its natural muscle contours tracing an untamed silhouette with perfect curves that make even the Intelligentsia Guild mathematicians drool.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' And that tail... it is jauntily swaying in the air, soft and comfy, like it is its own entity. It moves with a mind of its own in orderless chaos, as mesmerizing as a Lodell oscillator model.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The purity of nature, the simplicity of science &mdash; evolution has generously gifted both of these traits into one creation. You silently sidle close to this ape, your wriggling fingers barely able to suppress the excitement threatening to boil over in your heart.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Safe and gentle caresses. &mdash; Pet its head.
:{{DIcon|Star}} You need to be able to take risks! &mdash; Smooth out the fur on its hair.
:{{DIcon|Star}} I have a dangerous idea! &mdash; Poke its belly.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Leave wildlife alone. &mdash; Leave this place.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You sever your heart's desires with sheer resolution, in consideration of both your safety and the ape's mental health.


;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_422003)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The ape doesn't reject your touch. The fur on its head isn't too thick, but has the suppleness of a river stream. It actively rubs against the palm of your hand, cooing in an affectionate tone.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "Heh-heh, my fluffy." You scratch its chin. The ape curls into a ball, wrapping your entire body in a world of heavy fur, its tail whimsically twirling in the air.
::{{DIcon|Star}} There's something hidden in its fur. &mdash; Obtain 2 random Curio(s).
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You sever your heart's desires with sheer resolution, in consideration of both your safety and the ape's mental health.

:'''Simulated Universe:''' Your fingers lightly glide across the trail of fur and reach the ape's tail &mdash; it is soft to the touch, and its reflexive twitches in an attempt to escape your grasp evoke an inexplicable thrill within you.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "Heh-heh, my floofy floof." It stares at you, somewhat confused, but very quickly abandoning all thought. The ape turns around with its back to you, as if hinting at you to keep caressing it.

::'''Simulated Universe:''' Perhaps you accidentally touched its wound &mdash; or it is simply agitated &mdash; the ape brusquely leaps to its feet, bares its fangs, and bellows loudly in intimidation.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Unable to dodge in time, the ape's nails are already lunging at you at a speed that the naked eye cannot catch.
::{{DIcon|Star}} Gray Ape's attacks are super effective. &mdash; All allies lose HP equal to 30% of their current HP
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The ape disappears in the darkness. You should take comfort in the fact that it did not file an animal rights' violation complaint against you.

:'''Simulated Universe:''' You eagerly dip your fingers into the ape's tummy. The fur there is so long and lush, as if it could swallow up all sorrow &mdash; even the black hole of Nihility pales in comparison.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "Heh-heh, my floofy tummy." The wary ape gradually throws all caution to the wind under your caress, lounging limply across the rock, allowing another primate to play with it.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The sudden stimulus riles up the ape immensely, howling as it slaps away your hand, all its muscles tensed up. The sheer domination of nature, raw and without warning, emanates from its body.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' It furiously beats its chest, channeling a howl from its lungs, ready to mete deserved punishment on this unruly stranger.
::{{DIcon|Star}} Resistance is futile! &mdash; Enter a difficult battle.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You'll be caressing this fur today, whether the ape likes it or not!
