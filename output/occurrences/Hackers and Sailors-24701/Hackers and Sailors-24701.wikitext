{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You stand on the deck of the Invincible Voyager, watching the rippling waves on the surface of the water caused by the ship. The hacker sailors envelop the vessel in foam with aether editing, steering directly toward the dark side of the data ocean.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' As you also press forward, massive data streams infiltrate the foam, a data storm that corrodes the vessel. A purple lionfish swims before you. Startled, you step back, promptly turning it back into code before its poisonous spines reach you.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' In the dark web of Punklorde, this mere number combination of 0s and 1s is equivalent to an entire month's worth of equipment maintenance fees. You gaze into the unfathomable ocean, torn between the allure of vast opportunities and the peril of tempting fate.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Gather more of the deep data &mdash; A 90% chance to double the rewards and 10% chance to remove all rewards
:{{DIcon|Star}} Float toward the surface data &mdash; Obtain all rewards and leave (Current rewards: 100 Cosmic Fragments)
::'''Simulated Universe:''' There is always more code to be written as long as you still have your keyboard. As the most exceptional hacker in Punklorde, these trivial gains clearly won't sway your resolve.


;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_424704)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You navigate into a cluster of deserted historical data. Here, you assume the role of the fleet vanguard of the Yellow Citrus Nebula, who pilots a consciousness-integrated airship that requires ten tentacles for control, deftly maneuvering through swarms of enemy floating cannons.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You breach the enemy's defensive encirclement. The disguised smart code attempts to hide itself within the ship's engine, only to be captured by you and brought back to the ship beyond the data. The sensation of returning to your human form is truly comforting.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Do you want to continue diving?
::{{DIcon|Star}} Gather more of the deep data &mdash; A 70% chance to double the rewards and 30% chance to remove all rewards
::{{DIcon|Star}} Float toward the surface data &mdash; Obtain all rewards and leave (Current rewards: 200 Cosmic Fragments)
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' You feel the weight of your own work in your hand, the two strings of code gleaming like gems within the bag.
::;(Immediately ends the occurrence)

;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_424708)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' A bullet blasts by your ear. The graffiti data splatters everywhere, before being quickly programmed into explosives again. You narrowly escape the relentless pursuit of the assassin. Every frame of this timeless movie is etched into your memory.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' In the upcoming scene, Traitor No. 5 will expose her Furnace Core to disperse the heat. You will take away her prosthetic eye, where her consciousness resides. Who would hide code within an old movie that sank into the ocean? You sense yourself gradually adapting to these unfamiliar waters.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Do you want to continue diving?
::{{DIcon|Star}} Gather more of the deep data &mdash; A 30% chance to double the rewards and 70% chance to remove all rewards
::{{DIcon|Star}} Float toward the surface data &mdash; Obtain all rewards and leave (Current rewards: 800 Cosmic Fragments)
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' You disengage the network device within your brain, liberating yourself from the grip of deep data and returning to reality before slipping into unconsciousness.
::;(Immediately ends the occurrence)

;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_424712)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You sink into pink jelly, the taste of blue velvet still lingering on your palate. As you move your body, you find your limbs twisted like a jellyfish in a funhouse mirror and as crooked as macaroni.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You walk toward the periphery of the crystal unit. Following the Ternary Empire's unsuccessful conquest against the Binary Kingdom, fear permeates everyone's heart. When a binary intellitail songbird flies overhead, you whistle at it, compelling the code to obediently descend onto your fingertips.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Do you want to continue diving?
::{{DIcon|Star}} Gather more of the deep data &mdash; A 50% chance to double the rewards and 50% chance to remove all rewards
::{{DIcon|Star}} Float toward the surface data &mdash; Obtain all rewards and leave (Current rewards: 400 Cosmic Fragments)
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' Tenderly, you stroke the songbird's tail, within the feathers concealing the secret of a fabled hacker.
::;(Immediately ends the occurrence)

;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_424716)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Legend has it that the fabled hacker known as Zero left behind a code string potent enough to shake the world, hidden in the depths of this ocean, yet no one has been able to uncover any traces of it.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The vessel of aether editing has reached its maximum capacity, yet your interest in seeking out his treasure has waned.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You have demonstrated both your prowess as a legend and your courage as a hacker.
::{{DIcon|Star}} Float toward the surface data &mdash; Obtain 3,200 Cosmic Fragments
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Good morning, Punklorde! You shall soon embrace a new legend!
:;(Immediately ends the occurrence)

;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_424721)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Multiple currents converge here, giving rise to a paradise of chaos. You ride a mutant Nosewalker, racing atop a Giant Sting. A masked mimicry cheetah walks upright and holds hands with an egret to engage in a dance.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Your limbs are extended by the space, and they are almost nibbled by the passing insects. Yet, a bird swoops in to carry them away, leaving behind a vial of transparent ink. When you open it, the illicit history of corporations in the Oasis Zone stains it in black.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Do you want to continue diving?
::{{DIcon|Star}} Gather more of the deep data &mdash; A 10% chance to double the rewards and 90% chance to remove all rewards
::{{DIcon|Star}} Float toward the surface data &mdash; Obtain all rewards and leave (Current rewards: 1,600 Cosmic Fragments)
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' You hasten the ship's pace, steering it back to the comparatively hospitable side of Punklorde before it succumbs to destruction.
::;(Immediately ends the occurrence)

;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_424705)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' A cluster of junk data collides with the ship at a rapid pace. The infiltrating code tears your vessel apart, assimilating the data it carries. Just before being dragged into the depths of darkness, you reluctantly activate the emergency eject button.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Upon opening your eyes again, you find yourself stranded on the edge of the data ocean alongside the wreckage of the ship.
::{{DIcon|Star}} Collect the remaining data &mdash; Obtain 50 Cosmic Fragments
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Keep persevering, young hacker. Your triumph will come one day!
