==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You cross paths with a devout Wallbuilder brigade from Servia. They are pushing mine carts while building a high wall for the planet. A girl catches your eye. The color of the gravel behind her reflects on her chestnut hair.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' She is holding a heap of gleaming minerals with wood and gold mixed inside. You briefly catch sight of her eyes, from which sparkles pour down like galaxies.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' She speaks to you from a distance, "Qlipoth is gazing at us with a warm look. You can pick whatever you like from the excess materials."
:{{DIcon|Star}} Thank the Aeon Qlipoth. &mdash; Obtain 1 Scepter(s) of 2-star rarity.
;(Obtain a Normal Curio)
