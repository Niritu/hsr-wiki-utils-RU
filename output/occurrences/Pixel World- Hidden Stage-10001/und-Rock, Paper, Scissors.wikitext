:'''Simulated Universe:''' The astral computer before you, with a curved screen on top and a genderless human body at the bottom, is running a calculation at a high speed. While it seems to be simulating the collapse of a massive star, only you know that you are playing a game of rock-paper-scissors with it.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "There is an 82.49% chance of you playing rock in the first game, and a 94.61% of you playing scissors in the second. If you choose to flip the table with me and battle with the monsters I created, there is a 99.37% of you losing."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "But if you leave some Cosmic Fragments behind, your chance of survival is 100%." It is waiting for your response.
