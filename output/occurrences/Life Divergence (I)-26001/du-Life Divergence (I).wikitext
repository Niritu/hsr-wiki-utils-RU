:'''Simulated Universe:''' In the breeding records of the Caprists, you discover a statistical error. Creatures created in an environment with controlled temperatures show a deformity rate lower than its standard rates by 3% when their size expands.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' But you are fully aware that this is related to the current foundation of your research. Once this goes public, all existing academic progress will be destroyed.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Not to mention that the one who made the erroneous entry is a prominent scholar of the Grove. You look at the tiny critters multiplying before you, conflicted over whether to correct the error in the breeding scheme.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Ignore the mistakes. &mdash; Consume 50 Cosmic Fragments and gain 4 Blessing(s) required for Equations. Chance of error is greatly increased
::'''Simulated Universe:''' What's wrong with this data? It's already been in use for dozens of years. You must be the one who's wrong.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Perform corrections. &mdash; Gain 150 Cosmic Fragments. There will be no more errors
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Your conclusion garners the support of many esteemed seniors, but your peers in your school grow more estranged from you.
