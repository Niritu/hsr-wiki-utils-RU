==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You stroll through a cold, deserted alley. The dazzling light dispels the shadows, revealing an incomplete painting resting quietly in a corner.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' A monster lingers motionless on the paper, languishing in anticipation for someone to bring it back to life and grant it a tangible form through manifestation.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Despite not being a Punklordian hacker or a Mythus History Fictionologist, you feel confident that completing this painting with your artistic talent would be a walk in the park.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Wide, broad strokes &mdash; Spend 25 Cosmic Fragments with a 25% chance to obtain 1 Blessing(s) of 3-star rarity needed by Equations
:{{DIcon|Star}} Give up on painting &mdash; Decide to leave and obtain 1 random Blessing(s)
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You carefully wrap up the painting frame and sell it to a nearby monster collector with a decent reputation.


;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_424404)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Paint falls haphazardly on the paper, sprinkling across the face of the sleeping monster like grime accumulated across many long years. It seems like it does not approve of your postcosmic style of abstract art.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' No, no, no, you can't be the problem here. It's the paint. It's too low quality. Once you buy the highest-quality paint, you'll be able to paint this monster freehand, or even something like the Antimatter Legion.
::{{DIcon|Star}} Purchase high-quality paints &mdash; Spend 50 Cosmic Fragments with a 50% chance to obtain 1 Blessing(s) of 3-star rarity needed by Equations
::{{DIcon|Star}} Give up on painting &mdash; End things while you can. Leave and obtain 1 random Blessing(s)

;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_424408)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' As the most talented student in the studio, your art is avant-garde and worthy of praise from tens of thousands of patrons even at a mere Pier Point art exhibition. The reason this human you drew that so resembles a Shapeless creature could not fully manifest is just because of a difference in style.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Perhaps it's best to outsource this task of awakening the monster.
::{{DIcon|Star}} Hire a local illustrator &mdash; Spend 200 Cosmic Fragments with a 100% chance to obtain 1 Blessing(s) of 3-star rarity needed by Equations
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' As the bright colors and lines fall, the one-eyed and one-legged monster is suddenly granted new life.
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' "Whew, fresh air at long last. Thanks." It shakes its body and makes its way out of the flat canvas, disappearing into the distant rainbow.
::{{DIcon|Star}} Give up on painting &mdash; You're already majestically broke, so you decide to leave and obtain 1 random Blessing(s)
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' You carefully wrap up the painting frame and sell it to a nearby monster collector with a decent reputation.

;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_424412)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Viscous color flow across the paper, causing tears to fall from the monster's eye.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You're just rusty from not creating for so long. But it does not seem worth it to practice for the duration of a song for such a small painting.
::{{DIcon|Star}} Learn from a master &mdash; Spend 100 Cosmic Fragments with a 75% chance to obtain 1 Blessing(s) of 3-star rarity needed by Equations
