:'''Simulated Universe:''' Mr. Jibaou the radish! Glad to see you again. Congratulations on discovering the hidden stage of the Pixel World!
:'''Simulated Universe:''' This hidden stage will make you question your life choices!
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Now, you have no other means to cross the rapid stream, and there are three massive piranhas before you! You can only bet your life on a piranha that appears the friendliest and jump into its stomach to let it carry you across the river... Of course, you might perish in its belly if you make the wrong choice.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Choose number four! It has a tiny bow! &mdash; Obtain 2 Blessing(s) of the Path required for the Equation.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Choose number three. Its teeth are rusted... &mdash; Obtain 1 Equation(s) of 1- to 3-star rarity.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Choose number two. It snores like Andatur Zazzalo. &mdash; Enhance 5 random Blessing(s) of 2- to 3-star rarity.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You make the right choice!
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You stay in the piranha's stomach, waiting to cross the sea... You think to yourself, "Luckily, it doesn't eat carrots." Save your progress immediately when you reach the other side!
