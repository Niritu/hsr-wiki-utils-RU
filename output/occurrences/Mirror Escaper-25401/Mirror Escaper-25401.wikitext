{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' At the base of Epos' precipice, the maddened Titankin and monsters relentlessly pursue you from behind.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The collapsed bastion cuts the valley in half. From the statue's faded edges, they faintly reveal that it once belonged to a city that worshiped the Gate of Infinity.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You weave through the dilapidated ruins, attempting to navigate your way through shattered statues and altars, but a massive mirror on the stone wall blocks your way: "Those who enter must carry with them a thread of hope."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You have no time to ponder on the mirror's admonition. Muttering Janus' revered name under your breath, you dive into the mirror headfirst.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Float in the direction of the noise. &mdash; Cause the Stone Mirror to gain the effect: Trigger when entering Combat or Occurrence domains
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You tightly shut your eyes, as a thunderous crash echoes from the depths beneath your feet. You mutter Janus' name and press on.
::{{DIcon|Star}} Proceed toward the direction of the prayer. &mdash; Cause the Stone Mirror to gain the effect: There is a 30% chance of getting a random Curio. Negative Curios may be included
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' You make the ascent cautiously, not daring to look down. An inexplicable sense of foreboding tells you that one wrong step, and you'll be devoured by the endless abyss below.
:::{{DIcon|Star}} You feel this is the wrong direction. &mdash; Cause the Stone Mirror to gain the effect: Increases trigger chance by 20%
::::'''Simulated Universe:''' You can't tell how long you've walked, but a sturdy sensation finally meets your toes. Having survived the calamity, you let out a long sigh of relief and collapse to the ground.
::::'''Simulated Universe:''' The dampness of the grass, the fragrance of the earth... they all tell you that danger is far behind you. You stretch your arms, only for your hands to abruptly touch something cold.
::::{{DIcon|Star}} Pick up the mirror next to you. &mdash; Obtained Curio: Stone Mirror of Revelation
