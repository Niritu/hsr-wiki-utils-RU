:'''Simulated Universe:''' "You're back. I knew you wouldn't make me wait too long." She puts her chin on her crossed fingers, not at all surprised by your visit.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "This is the Angel-type I.O.U. Dispenser. You need to feed Gold Coins into it regularly, and it will keep a record of your investment. At the end of the investment term, it will pay you an amount ten times your principal."
