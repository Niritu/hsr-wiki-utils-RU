:'''Simulated Universe:''' "The 60-natural-year cycle is about to start again, and Vonwacq's Cyclic Demon Lord will be born from the fruit of a certain type of tree. We're here to wipe this data from the biological database, as the Cyclic Demon Lord is just an alien bug!" A man declared.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Once the Demon Lord emerges from the fruit and lands on the ground, it will deal a devastating blow to our civilization. Calculations show that we are just f&mdash;f&mdash;four cycles away from its arrival!" Another outsider remarks in a trembling voice.
