==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You find yourself on a nameless planet full of towering metallic structures. Among the ruins basked in faint sunlight, a massive, sophisticated machine slowly makes its way toward you. It picks up the parts scattered all over the ground and fixes them onto its fortress-like body in an orderly manner.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The piston rises and falls, resulting in a vigorous lever effect that brings about the turning of the gears. The machine emits a deep growl as it mends its damaged body with little hope of completion.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' An old man approaches you with one-half of his arm drooping. The ancient Intellitron is unfazed by the peculiar scene before him. Using his last piece of visual crystal he has, he fixates his gaze upon you, an unexpected visitor, and nods approvingly.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "How nostalgic. Once, there was also an organic creature like you standing here, marveling at the lives created by the emperor."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened next?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who is he?
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "How could I possibly remember?" The ancient Intellitron shakes his head, and a string of chewed cables falls out along with several oxidized chips engraved with the crest of the Rubert Empire. "They say I'm broken, just like this kid here."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The dreadful steel fortress comes to a halt behind the old man. Its gears grind against each other non-stop, producing an odd noise. It seems to be responding to the old man's commands.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "The emperor's legacy isn't only available for inorganic creatures. If you can free yourself from your current shackles... it will guide you in the right direction." A faint crimson light flashes in the Intellitron's eyes. His words send ripples of resonance in your consciousness like a spell.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Touch the legacy of the empire. &mdash; There is a very low chance of receiving a response from the legacy: Obtain 300 Cosmic Fragments, 3 random Blessing(s), and 3 random Curio(s).
:{{DIcon|Star}} Accept the legacy of the empire. &mdash; Spend 300 Cosmic Fragments and gain 2 random Rubert Empire series Curio(s).
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The old man takes two parts from the metal behemoth and hands them over to you solemnly. A plethora of equations alters your cognition, their intense reverberations causing your head to split.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The battered moving fortress glides past the top of your head. Your heart almost stops beating because of the enormous roar.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' By the time you snap out of your trance, the ancient Intellitron has gone far with the machine, leaving behind tire tracks on the ground.
:;(Immediately ends the occurrence)
:{{DIcon|Star}} Embrace the legacy of the empire. &mdash; Gain 1 random Rubert Empire series Curio(s).
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The old man takes a part from the metal behemoth. The part moves closer to the rest of the parts surrounding you in apparent eagerness. Amid their resonance, you seem to discern the lingering voice of the Emperor Rubert.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The battered moving fortress glides past the top of your head. Your heart almost stops beating because of the enormous roar.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' By the time you snap out of your trance, the ancient Intellitron has gone far with the machine, leaving behind tire tracks on the ground.
:;(Immediately ends the occurrence)
:{{DIcon|Star}} Return the legacy of the empire. &mdash; Lose the Curio Rubert Empire Difference Machine. Obtains 2,400 Cosmic Fragments, 24 random Blessing(s), and 24 random Curio(s).
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The old man stares at you blankly, his obsolete logic chip unable to comprehend your actions. With his hands trembling, he takes the difference machine from you, looking just like an ordinary, despondent citizen of a fallen kingdom.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The battered moving fortress glides past the top of your head. Your heart almost stops beating because of the enormous roar.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' By the time you snap out of your trance, the ancient Intellitron has gone far with the machine, leaving behind tire tracks on the ground.


;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_12)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' A grand formula unfolds in your mind. Cold data permeates your perception, waiting for subtle changes to take place in the future.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The battered moving fortress glides past the top of your head. Your heart almost stops beating because of the enormous roar.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' By the time you snap out of your trance, the ancient Intellitron has gone far with the machine, leaving behind tire tracks on the ground.

;(Unused &mdash; triggerEvent_13)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The colossal metal behemoth has not responded to your expectations. However, there is no need to rush because one day, the successor to the Empire will come here.
