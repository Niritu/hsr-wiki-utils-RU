:'''Simulated Universe:''' You open its manual, which reads, "This is a doll to vent extreme emotions on, made by Aha in THEIR own likeness. THEY wish to see THEMSELF beaten up. The worse the beating is, the happier THEY will get, and the more Gold Coins THEY will award you! Note: Aha is not involved in the quality control process."
