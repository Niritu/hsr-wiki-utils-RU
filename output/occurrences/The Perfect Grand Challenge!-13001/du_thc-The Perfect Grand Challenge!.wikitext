:'''Simulated Universe:''' An arcade machine appears in front of you in the deserted Interastral Department Store building. Trendy gachapon figures, ether orbs, and clay dolls are stacked inside the display cabinet. Electronic music and colorful lights come alive as you approach.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "I'm the perfect man in the arcade!" The arcade machine starts to play an electronic voice. You suppose this was added by a playful programmer...

:{{DIcon|Star}} Leave. &mdash; Something's afoot!

:'''Simulated Universe:''' You slowly move the claw to your target... and lose your patience! You give the machine a vicious kick, hoping it can make the claw move faster!
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Surprisingly, your powerful kick gives the voltage of the machine a surge! With a clank, the claw grabs a trendy *clay doll* by its head. It starts spinning out of control, twisting the figure's head!
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The head of the clay doll explodes! Fireworks burst out from the head, and you watch the bizarre scene with your jaw on the floor.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "Perfect... Perfect... The universe needs *perfection*!" The final program says.
