:'''Simulated Universe:''' This is your first time leaving your homeland of Okhema. The light weight of your armor lifts your spirits. You shoulder a shoddily-crafted spear discarded by its smith, and heroic poems hummed by traveling bards play over and over in your mind.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Share a drink with waves that are the manifestation of Phagousa on the sea and venture into the nether realm in search of your dead lover. One day, there will be a spot for you as well.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You hear that Castrum Kremnos is holding a new tournament. Kephale above, it appears you are destined to seize your inaugural glory there.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Take off the armor and redeploy with light gear. &mdash; All allies lose 80% of current HP. After achieving victory, gain 2 random Curio(s) of 2-star rarity and 2 Blessing(s) of 1- to 3-star rarity
::'''Simulated Universe:''' What a warrior! Even the local spectators at Castrum Kremnos can't help but cheer you on.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Make a bet on your own defeat first. &mdash; After achieving victory, obtain 300 Cosmic Fragments
::'''Simulated Universe:''' A hero who believes in failing isn't a hero? No matter how much one loses, one shouldn't lose money, right?
