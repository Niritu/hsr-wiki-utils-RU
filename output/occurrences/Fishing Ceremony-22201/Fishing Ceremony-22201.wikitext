{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You sit by the dam of the crystal sea. A massive feathered whale traverses the material world's border, leaping out of the surface, then swiftly crashing back into the scintillating crystal structure.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Hundreds of thousands of anglers jostle about, their hands grappling at phase-shifting fishing rods and letting their bait sink into the crystalline depths.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The Dygnans use angling to offer prayers to the Crystal Mother, and she gives everyone reciprocating rewards based on each of their will. After saying this, the High Priest hangs a piece of gold to the hook, casting it powerfully into the solid sea.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Simply put, as long as you offer tribute, you can catch anything you want here, even fish." The guide irreverently translates.
:{{DIcon|Star}} I want to get rich. &mdash; Fish up Cosmic Fragments.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You tie your consciousness and the fishing line in your hand together. The High Priest says that this thread was crafted from the Crystal Mother's body. You hear an affectionate voice querying you from all around.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The crystal uses its own body to nurture reality. What tribute do you intend to offer to sate the thirst of the transcendental world?
::{{DIcon|Star}} Offer blood. &mdash; All allies lose 99% of current HP and lose all Energy and Technique Points
::{{DIcon|Star}} Offer the future. &mdash; Obtain 1 random Negative Curio(s)
::{{DIcon|Star}} Offer the past. &mdash; Lose 1 random Blessing(s)
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You cast the heavy fishing hook, and it slowly penetrates into the crystal, sinking into a domain that the eye cannot fathom.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You suddenly feel something graze your face &mdash; a gust, a raindrop &mdash; it tells you to reel your line in, to end this tribute to the Crystal Mother.
::{{DIcon|Star}} Reel in the line. &mdash; Obtain 400 Cosmic Fragments
::'''Simulated Universe:''' A glittering gem completely envelops the hook. Through its glinting surface, you glimpse something languidly writhing within.
:{{DIcon|Star}} I want to receive benedictions. &mdash; Fish up Blessings.
