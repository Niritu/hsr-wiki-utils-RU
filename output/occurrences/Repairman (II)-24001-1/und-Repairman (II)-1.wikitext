:'''Simulated Universe:''' You once again return to the repairman's workshop. As if he had a premonition of your arrival, he lays out a pile of parts neatly on the table as he excitedly hums a little tune.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "There's nothing in this world that has no value. There are only things with value that have not been discovered yet."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Military titles, weapons, funds, and research labs... Do so-called 'things of value' still have value when they take away joy? It took me many years to understand this."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Do you remember the scraps you left behind? I made them into new toys. Why don't you have a go? I believe you can do it." The old man pushes the parts to you with an expectant look in his eyes.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Add a few components. &mdash; Let waste be reborn as smiles.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Add a bit of inspiration. &mdash; Spend 100 Cosmic Fragments to create more toys.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Pour in a little joy. &mdash; Spend 400 Cosmic Fragments to create more toys.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The discarded parts are combined into misshapen toys, yet you feel a smile controllably creeping up on the ends of your lips.
