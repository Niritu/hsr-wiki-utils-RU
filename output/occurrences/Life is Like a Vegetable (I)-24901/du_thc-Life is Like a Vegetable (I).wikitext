:'''Simulated Universe:''' You enter a restaurant on Planet Adina. An old-fashioned sign in dazzling colors slowly rotates while informing patrons that dogs and Fools are not allowed entry. A tailless goldfish sits on a plate, its protruding fish eyes rotating as it chooses a taste experience that suits you.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Gourmet cooking grants a sampling of life. A banquet of Xianzhou flavors is more worthy of your tongue's consideration than a showing of immersia." The goldfish makes a strange gurgling sound in its throat.
