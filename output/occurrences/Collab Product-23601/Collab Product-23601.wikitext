{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' In the bustling Interastral Department Store, a capsule machine coquettishly appears before you. Its dazzling lights, ear-shredding music, and countless shoe prints all over its surface are evident proof of its immense popularity.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Limited-edition Intelligentsia Guild collab capsules, surely worthy of your possession." Do people actually want this thing? You plant your face against the capsule machine, peering into its contents, to see if it carries merchandise of those familiar to you.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "How about it? Try your hand?" The capsule machine speaks out the thoughts in your head.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Chasing excitement. &mdash; Spend 200 Cosmic Fragments and pull 5 time(s)
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Doctor DeWitt's photos in his heyday. Doctor DeWitt's invention catalog. Doctor DeWitt's research journal during his student days... Whoever this Doctor DeWitt is, he sure is narcissistic.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' But, since you're already here, might as well see who else is in those capsules?
::{{DIcon|Star}} Chasing excitement. &mdash; Spend 200 Cosmic Fragments and pull 5 time(s)
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' Doctor DeWitt's cautionary maxims. Doctor DeWitt's full collection of jokes and dry jokes. Doctor DeWitt's speech to graduates. What, did the Intelligentsia Guild only use Doctor DeWitt in this collaboration?
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' Calm down. You've already pulled so many times. It's about time a rare character pops up. Why not give it one more twist?
:::{{DIcon|Star}} Chasing excitement. &mdash; Spend 200 Cosmic Fragments and pull 5 time(s)
::::'''Simulated Universe:''' You already know what you've got the moment the capsule rolls out.
::::'''Simulated Universe:''' This garbage capsule machine, and this garbage Doctor DeWitt.
:::{{DIcon|Star}} Consider it as helping out the Guild's business. &mdash; Spend 50 Cosmic Fragments and pull 1 time(s)
::::'''Simulated Universe:''' You already know what you've got the moment the capsule rolls out.
