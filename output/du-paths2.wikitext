==Glossary==
===Aftertaste===
Random-Type Additional DMG. The DMG is considered as Follow-up ATK DMG.

===AoE ATK===
A kind of ability tag. Ability effects that are primarily AoE attacks will have this tag.

===Blazar===
30% of HP changes or Shield reductions will be converted into "Blazar" Charge. Charge value is cleared by 60% at the start of the turn, and "Blazar" can use this Charge to deal DMG or trigger other effects.

===Brain in a Vat===
If the Enlightenment Charge of "Brain in a Vat" reaches 100%, when a character uses their Ultimate through a method other than "Brain in a Vat," the Ultimate will be activated again, consuming 100% of the Enlightenment Charge.

===Critical Boost===
Each stack increases CRIT Rate by 6% and CRIT DMG by 12%, stacking up to 8 time(s). This can be inherited by an ally at the beginning of the next turn. All stacks will be removed if any ally is attacked.

===Harmonize===
Increases the holder's Break DMG taken by 25%. At the start of the turn, if the holder is Weakness Broken, take Quantum Break DMG equal to 60% base DMG for each stack of "Harmonize," up to 40 stack(s). Cleared when recovering from Weakness Break.

===Murmur===
When enemy targets enter the battle, they are inflicted with this state. This is considered as the Wind Shear state. At the start of a turn, deals Wind DoT equal to Charge value, and clear any Charge values that exceed the threshold. The threshold is equal to 4,000% of the sum of all allies' ATK.

===Obsession===
Each stack increases all ally targets' ATK by 1% and Max HP by 0.5%. Each target can have up to 20 stacks, and they lose 2 stack(s) at the end of each turn.

===Soul Chrysalis/Butterfly Soul===
"Soul Chrysalis" is a Charge ratio shared by all allies. When reaching 100%, it transforms into "Butterfly Soul." After entering the "Butterfly Soul" state, the next 8 time(s) any ally target uses Basic ATK/Skill to attack, deals 1 instance of True DMG equal to 50% of the original DMG (not including the Additional DMG) to the attack target.

===Super Break DMG===
Super Break DMG increases with higher Break Effect, higher Toughness Reduction of the attack, and higher character levels.<br />Super Break DMG cannot CRIT Hit and is not affected by DMG Boost effects.<br />Super Break DMG is also considered Break DMG.
