===Check with Clara on how the robot is doing===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|You receive Clara's new message. She seems to have finished repairing the little robot.<br />Maybe you can see how things are going at Svarog's Base when you have the time. Remember, you promised her to go &mdash;<br />No one can break a promise to Clara. No one.}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Head to the machine graveyard with Clara to look for a suitable shell===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|Clara seemed to have given the little robot a nice name. It is now called Pascal. This name makes you feel a bit different towards it... but it could also just be an illusion. Forget about it &mdash; You currently face a more important matter.<br />Pascal doesn't seem to be able to talk fluently. To fix this problem, Clara and you have to look for a suitable robot shell to place it into.}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Return to Svarog's Base and fix Pascal===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|Clara and you had a thorough search in the machine graveyard and finally found parts you can use.<br />Return to Svarog's Base and see if the shell can get Pascal back to normal.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Follow Pascal, who had run away===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Rivet Town|update|You fixed Pascal. Its core fitted into the new shell nicely. But Pascal was not completely fixed &mdash; After receiving the new shell, Pascal malfunctioned again and ran away toward Rivet Town.<br />Clara and you decide to head out immediately to look for Pascal and prevent it from causing incidents outside of Svarog's Base.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Follow Pascal===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Rivet Town|update|Clara and you found Pascal. It seemed to have been subdued by one of Svarog's automatic robot soldiers. However, you did not have a nice experience communicating with that robot soldier.<br />Anyways, the incident is mostly solved &mdash; Pascal finally returns to normal after being given the last shell, then walks on its own to lead you somewhere deep in Rivet Town.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Keep following Pascal===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Rivet Town|update|Clara and you followed Pascal's steps and strolled along the streets of Rivet Town. During this, Clara asked you a question that you also found puzzling. "Why do the lights in Rivet Town never go out?"<br />You don't have the answer yet, but instinctively feel that the answer to this question lies somewhere in town.<br />Perhaps &mdash; and I mean "perhaps" &mdash; Pascal knows the truth about this?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Investigate the Tempering Workshop===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Rivet Town|update|Pascal led Clara and you to the abandoned workshop in Rivet Town, the Tempering Workshop. You piece together some of the motivations underlying Pascal's behavior from its broken speech.<br />Pascal seemed to have treated this place as its secret base and maintained the entire Rivet Town ceaselessly from here.<br />But there are still many mysteries surrounding Pascal &mdash; Perhaps a thorough investigation at the Tempering Workshop could solve the puzzle.}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Continue investigating the Tempering Workshop===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Rivet Town|update|Pascal led Clara and you to the abandoned workshop in Rivet Town, the Tempering Workshop. You piece together some of the motivation underlying Pascal's behavior from its broken speech.<br />Pascal seemed to have treated this place as its secret base and maintained the entire Rivet Town ceaselessly from here.<br />You find some suspicious objects, but they don't really explain much &mdash; Keep looking around for a bit longer.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Return to the Base with Clara===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|Pascal's diary revealed the cruel truth behind the parts theft and the lights that never went out in Rivet Town.<br />What will happen to this poor robot after knowing all this? Neither you nor Clara could make up your mind.<br />Why don't you return to Svarog's Base and discuss the possibilities with the one person (or rather, robot) in Belobog who understands automatic robot soldiers the most.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Convince Clara or Svarog to take up the other's plan and decide on Pascal's fate===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|Svarog and Clara both stated their thoughts but you, the hero who saved Belobog, have the power to decide.<br />Think carefully and decide on Pascal's fate.}}
