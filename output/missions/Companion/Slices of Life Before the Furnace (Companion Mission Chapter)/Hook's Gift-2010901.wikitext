===Ask about the details of the auction===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You're informed that an auction will be held by the "Wildfire" in the underworld.<br />For more details, you need to consult the auction staff in Boulder Town. Go there if you're interested.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Tell Hook about the auction===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You didn't expect to find a probe for the vein detector at this auction. This is a great gift, so you decide to tell Hook about it.<br />Now you can sell the toy bear "Junjun" and buy a perfect gift. Great!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Return to the clinic, find Natasha, and get the toy bear===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|To get "Junjun," you have to return to the clinic. Maybe Natasha will teach Hook another lesson.<br />But an auction is much safer than the Fragmentum, so Natasha might agree to let you go. Wait, perhaps you shouldn't reveal the truth to her...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Talk to the auctioneer to learn more details===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|To sell "Junjun" at a good price, you need to figure out the rules of this auction. Asking the auctioneer is a wise choice.<br />After all, you need to register this toy bear, and preparation is necessary if you want a decent result.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Find buyers and try to sell the toy at a high price===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The more buyers who participate in the auction, the higher the bidding price of "Junjun." You don't know the plans of the buyers present, but the more, the merrier.<br />Everybody here will know that the cute toy bear "Junjun" will be auctioned today!}}

===Talk to the auctioneer and wait for the auction to begin===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Every possible buyer at the auction can help you sell "Junjun" at a high price. Once you're ready, find the auctioneer and wait for the auction to begin.<br />Keep looking and searching, because everyone here might become a fan of "Junjun."}}

===(Optional) Find a potential buyer and help the lost child===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|It's crowded at the auction, and criminals might seize this opportunity to wreak havoc. Of course, the Moles will not stand by idly.<br />What have these bad guys done? ...Robbing a kid? Hey, stop!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===(Optional) Find a potential buyer and talk to the old lady===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|As someone with a high sense of responsibility, you need to be sure that the old lady has found her grandson.<br />Perhaps she will buy "Junjun" out of joy... This sounds unrealistic, but who knows?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===(Optional) Find a potential buyer and find the robot that took the contract===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The robots in this world are even smarter than humans, and one of them stole a commodity contract.<br />There is a suspicious robot in this machine graveyard. You're pretty sure you can identify it in an ocean of similar robots... if you're lucky!}}

===(Optional) Find a potential buyer and return the contract to whoever lost it===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You find a name on the contract... Is he the poor soul whose contract was stolen by this robot? You'd better find him.<br />If you return this contract to him, maybe he'll participate in the auction for "Junjun." This sounds scheming, but maybe it will work!}}

===(Optional) Find a potential buyer and talk to Gertie of the Goethe Grand Hotel===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You heard that Aunt Gertie was going to buy a toy, but she returned to Boulder Town because she found nothing attractive. This is your chance!<br />You're going to tell Gertie that "Junjun" is being auctioned, and she's not going to want to miss out!}}
