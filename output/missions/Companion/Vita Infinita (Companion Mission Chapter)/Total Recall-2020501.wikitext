===Chat with Fu Xuan about how to search for lost memories===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Fu Xuan is not opposed to the request to use the Matrix of Prescience Ultima to deduce the past. Seems like this isn't her first time helping someone with something like this.<br />As long as enough data is provided to support its calculations, deducing the past is the same as predicting the future for the Matrix of Prescience.}}

===Ask Fu Xuan to place March 7th into the Matrix of Prescience to recall her memories===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The preparations are complete. All that is left is for March 7th to connect with the Matrix of Prescience Ultima. Then, you will be able to use the Matrix of Prescience's outstanding calculation capacity to explore her past.<br />March 7th seems to be a little anxious, and you are rather worried, too. However, you are unable to go with her on this journey. You have to put your faith in Fu Xuan's skills...}}
