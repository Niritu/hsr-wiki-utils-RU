===Point out the fake Fu Xuan===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|As the Matrix of Prescience Ultima starts its calculations, March 7th returns to the not-too-distant past.<br />For her own safety, she should first complete the homework Fu Xuan assigned.<br />Thankfully, the task isn't too hard. She just has to figure out who is the real master diviner out of the two before her.}}

===Find the "surreal" part of this memory===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Memories of the Xianzhou Luofu are very recent and are still fresh in her mind. However, March 7th still feels rather sad as she gazes upon the people and events in her memory.<br />"It hasn't been that long, but many things won't ever be the same again," she thinks to herself.}}

===Interact with the "abnormality" and regress to an older memory===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|"Touch the heater" sounds like a terrible idea. However, this isn't reality, and real-life common sense doesn't apply here.<br />March 7th trusts that Fu Xuan will not hurt her... but she still instinctively doesn't want to touch something as hot as this.}}
