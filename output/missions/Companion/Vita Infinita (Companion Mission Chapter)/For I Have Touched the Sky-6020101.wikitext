{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Stargazer Navalia|update|The Sky-Faring Commission sent a message saying that there was a starskiff crash in Stargazer Navalia, and hopes you can help rescue the victim. Welt seems to be nearby. Hurry up and join him in searching for the victim.}}

===Use the cycrane to search for the victim===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Stargazer Navalia|update|The terrain of Stargazer Navalia is complex, and searching on foot is rather difficult.

===Ask Yanming about Yukong's past===

===Head to the Palace of Astrum and accept Yukong's gratitude===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Stargazer Navalia|update|The girl you and Welt rescued seems to be Yukong's daughter. To express her gratitude, Yukong hopes that you can go to the Palace of Astrum for a cup of tea with her. When you dealt with Yukong before, the atmosphere was inevitably rather awkward. Now you finally have a chance to have a cup of tea in peace... At least that's what you and Welt hope.}}

===Leave the Palace of Astrum===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Stargazer Navalia|update|As if being struck by some strange curse, meetings between the Astral Express crew and Yukong always seems to be tied to some kind of awkward situation. Welt and you don't want to be involved in other people's family affairs, so it's best to leave the Palace of Astrum first. Hopefully the atmosphere will be less tense the next time you meet with Yukong...}}

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Unwittingly, you and Welt still got tied up in Yukong's family affairs.
