===Find the "surreal" part of this memory===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|People usually think about blizzards and freezing temperatures when it comes to Belobog, but the most profound memory March 7th have of that place is the impressive lobby of the Goethe Hotel.<br />She claims it is because she became a wanted criminal the day after she checked into the hotel. However... perhaps it is because a bright yet brief campfire is more memorable than even an epic in the dead of winter, no matter how magnificent the journey was.}}

===Interact with the "abnormality" and regress to an older memory===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|March 7th really doesn't think "a monitor from the Herta Space Station" can represent the entire station. She surmises that this item appeared here only because the station is positively covered by monitors of the same model and build... Their overwhelming presence had stamped themselves indelibly into her memory.<br />"But that's not half bad," she thought. "The only other memorable thing I have from there is the Doomsday Beast... Thank goodness it's the monitors that showed up!"}}
