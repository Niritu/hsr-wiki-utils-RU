===Find the "abnormality" in this memory===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|March 7th is now one step closer to the end (or the beginning) and finally sees the mastermind who has been placing obstacles along the way &mdash; It is the Messenger.<br />The Messenger seems to have locked March 7th and Fu Xuan into a memory that is an enclosed loop. March 7th was still a nameless girl drifting in space, until the Astral Express saved her, and she gained a "family" for the first time.<br />March 7th would love to stay in this memory for longer if this weren't a part of the Messenger's plot &mdash; Everyone misses their home and secretly wishes the peaceful everyday life they share with their family could last forever into the future and the past...<br />Unfortunately, that is simply not possible.}}
