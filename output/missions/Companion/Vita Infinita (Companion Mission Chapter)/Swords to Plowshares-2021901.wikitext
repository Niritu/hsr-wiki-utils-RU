===Go to the Palace of Astrum's backyard and check in on March 7th's swordplay training===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|Ever since March 7th became a disciple of Yanqing and Yunli, you notice she's practically bubbling with excitement like a kid at summer camp. You've also been missing her on the Express. But all enthusiasm will eventually dampen, and by then, she'll realize that swordplay training isn't child's play.<br />March 7th should be practicing in the backyard now. Check in on her as you deem fit to see if her passion has faded at all.}}
