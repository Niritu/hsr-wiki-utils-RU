===Head to the Seat of Divine Foresight and ask after how the Stellaron Hunter has been doing lately===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|Unwilling to let your friend on the Express become entangled in grievances from a previous life, you decide to enter the fray on your own volition.<br />Speculating on the intentions of the letter, you believe that blade-wielding Stellaron Hunter to be the most likely sender, fixated on sorting out past grudges. However, his "invitations" have always been direct and aggressive. What would be the purpose of sending this letter? You decide to head to the Seat of Divine Foresight and inquire after the whereabouts of the Hunter's location from the general.}}
