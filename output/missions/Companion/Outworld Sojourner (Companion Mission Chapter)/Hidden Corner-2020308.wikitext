===Pry open the lock of the door that seals the dock===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|According to Genius Detective March 7th's deduction, a door lock like this could not stop Luocha, but visualizing a gentlemanly Luocha picking the lock while squatting in a dark corner like this is pretty humorous. Heh.}}

===Find the meet-up point on the dock===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|According to Genius Detective March 7th's deduction, Luocha should have met with the Stellaron buyer here. Look around, there should be a location suitable for illegal trades around.}}

===Find the meet-up point in the super dangerous dock===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|According to Genius Detective March 7th's deduction, if Luocha spent two whole hours to complete the trade, it must mean it is super dangerous, with monsters all around.<br />Hmm? Isn't this a detective story? Why are there so many combat fillers?}}

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|According to Genius Detective March 7th's deduction, after a danger-laden adventure, Luocha finally reached the meet-up point. Who is so daring as to purchasing Stellaron to wreak havoc on the Xianzhou ship?}}
