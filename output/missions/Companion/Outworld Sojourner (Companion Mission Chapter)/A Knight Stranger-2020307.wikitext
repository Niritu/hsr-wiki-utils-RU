===Speak with Dahao at the Realm-Keeping Commission===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|After the Stellaron Crisis outbreak, the six commissions were busy as a bee trying to find the perpetrator in vain. Official Dahao of the Realm-Keeping Commission requested support from the Astral Express to identify suspects. Sounds like another bothersome case... However, as a Nameless, you should lend a helping hand as much as you can. Go talk to him.}}

===Speak with Jingyan and check the video recording the cycrane took===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|In the process of helping the Realm-Keeping Commission in identifying suspects, something unexpected happened. The Realm-Keeping Commission isn't too anxious about it, but Welt was. The moment he saw Luocha's flawless face, he was stunned and cold sweat drenched his shirt. You don't know the reason, but Welt must have a good reason for being so unnerved. Continue to investigate this Mr. Luocha.<br />Say, what is March 7th so excited about, and since when did she have a "Genius Detective" tacked onto her name?}}

===Find Yinshu at the Exalting Sanctum and talk to her===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|After leaving the daylight-robbing thug, you can finally meet Yinshu.<br />A little secret for you: Genius Detective March 7th loved the experience, because even genius detectives need to encounter unreasonable, daylight-robbing, uncultured witnesses like that. It made her feel even more like a genius detective.}}

===Return to the Realm-Keeping Commission and learn about the new clues of the case from Jingyan===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|An obscure corner, mysterious men in black, a torn-off title page... Pieces of evidence slowly emerged to put together the puzzle. Maybe you only need a final puzzle piece to complete the quest... Is the new piece of information Jingyan had come into the key puzzle piece you need?}}

===Collaborate with March 7th to put on her detective show===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|The boring evidence-collection task finally ended, and it is time for the mind-bending, action-packed deduction segment!<br />Genius Detective March 7th is confident to reveal the truth to the world as she gets to the bottom of the case.<br />Luck be with her.}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Leave the Realm-Keeping Commission and check out the "scene of the crime"===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|Maybe because of some missing key information, or maybe it's because a certain genius detective's reasoning skills is incongruous with the truth, or maybe, Luocha was just too good... Genius Detective March 7th's first detective debut doesn't seem to be very successful. You decide to check out the scene of the crime, armchair detectives have limited understanding, after all.}}

===Listen to what Jingyan is telling Back'n and Forth===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|The moment you step out of the Realm-Keeping Commission, you see three individuals discussing something. One of them is Jingyan, and the other two are Back'n and Forth of crosstalk fame.<br />You detected a few keywords in their conversation... Blonde, Outworlder, savior... This isn't the key information on Luocha's disappearance, is it?}}

===Find Yinshu, the shopkeeper of Spare Time Book Shop, at the Exalting Sanctum===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|Yinshu has appeared in that obscure corner with two men in black, in the period that Luocha happened to be there. Maybe Yinshu can provide some eyewitness statements to help you understand what Luocha was up to.}}
