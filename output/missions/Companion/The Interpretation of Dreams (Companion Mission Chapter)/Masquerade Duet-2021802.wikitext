===Investigate the crime scene===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|This dreamscape that Black Swan has prepared is way too exciting, throwing you into a "crime scene" As soon as you enter. Here you see Black Swan, a Bloodhound Family Law Enforcer, and... Sampo!? What is that guy doing here!?}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Ask the Bloodhound Family member about the case===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|It seems that there was a "murder case" (fortunately, in Penacony, it is almost impossible for people to actually be "murdered"), and the murderer is without question the enigmatic Sparkle. It seems that Black Swan has no intention of telling the Bloodhound Family about the murderer's identity. She is instead planning on playing with Sparkle. You cannot grasp what either Sparkle or Black Swan is thinking.}}

===Speak with the constable and the bailiff===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Sparkle left a lot of items behind at the crime scene and used them to construct a bizarre stage play. It seems that this "murder" was simply a bait to attract the attention of her audience, and this "puzzle" was actually the challenge that she had left for Black Swan.}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Ask the bailiff about suspects===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Black Swan begins collecting clues, trying to solve the puzzle that Sparkle left behind. You can't help but wonder why Sparkle would go through all this effort. However, when it comes to people like Sparkle, asking "why" normally means you are on the wrong track. Why not play with Black Swan the logic game that Sparkle left behind... Perhaps Sparkle's true motive is concealed within.}}

===Hurry to the scene of Sparkle's upcoming crime===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You have solved the puzzle, but the game is not over. The "constable" has told Black Swan that Sparkle is about to commit another murder, and Black Swan definitely would not have enough time to stop her. You feel a brief but intense surge of emotion flash across the Dreamscape, likely because Black Swan dislikes this feeling of being led on a wild goose chase by others.}}

===Speak with the sheriff and the deputy sheriff===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Another murder, another play, and another puzzle. Sampo seems extremely distressed and ready to escape back into his secluded and quiet Winterland. Black Swan, on the other hand, seems calm and contented, thoroughly enjoying the detective game that Sparkle prepared. However, they are not the type to have their emotions displayed across their faces, so you are uncertain whether they are really distressed or calm.<br />However, the Dreamscape Sales Store is still a place of entertainment, so perhaps it would be better to focus on investigating the puzzle Sparkle left behind than trying to assess the true thoughts of these "characters." Let's enjoy a game of logic and deduction.}}

===Hurry to Sparkle's hiding spot===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|"Challenge the audience"... You have read a lot of detective novels that March 7th shoved into your hands and are no stranger to this kind of plot. Although, normally it's the job of the author or the detective to challenge the reader (or audience), is it not? How is it that in Sparkle's game, it's the murderer who's throwing down the gauntlet? Surely this is closer to "threatening the audience" than challenging...? It's just what you've come to expect from Sparkle.<br />Either way, happy hunting.}}

===Inspect the unusual trashcan===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|What stands before Black Swan in this moment is undoubtedly a trashcan. A Belobogian-style trashcan. This sight is supposed to shock you, but it does not. You have seen many strange things on your journeys. This sense of being unfazed by the bizarre makes you feel like you have really gained some life experience.}}
