===Speak with Dr. Edward===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You receive a message from Dr. Edward. Dr. Edward has invited you to the Dreamscape Sales Store to experience a dream left for you by a lady named "Black Swan." Of course, you know who Black Swan is, but cannot think why she would have left a dream for you. Go to the Dreamscape Sales Store to see. Perhaps you will only receive your answer once you experience it for yourself.}}
