{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dewlight Pavilion|update|You two reach a foyer full of statues and realize there is no way to proceed further...

Could he have studied the script before?}}

That's exactly what you need. To meet him, you visit the Dewlight Pavilion with Dr. Ratio... having no inkling of the perils that lie ahead of you.<br />Talk to Hendrick the guard and embark on you two's adventure at the Dewlight Pavilion.}}

===Inspect the sandpit===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dewlight Pavilion|update|As expected, things are far from straightforward.

He speculates that the key to unlocking the door is hidden in the sandpit in the center of the hall.}}

===Look for the sandpit clue in the treasure room===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dewlight Pavilion|update|There is a noticeable gap in the sandpit model, which might just be the key clue to unlocking the council chamber. As far as Dr. Ratio can remember, the block that can fit the gap is kept in the treasure room nearby.<br />You two arrive at the treasure room, all set to pursue a degree in burglary &mdash; that is, to look for the missing part of the sandpit model. Good luck.}}
