|summary       = Alongside Phainon and Mydei, you head to the mobile fortress of Castrum Kremnos. During your expedition, you learn that Nikador had long schemed against Okhema. Fighting your way through countless foes, you planned to directly eliminate Nikador, only to discover that they had managed to gain an undying body long ago. Nikador invoked the Body of a Hundred Deaths to temper blades, aiming to swing the Blade of Fury to pierce the distant Okhema. In this moment of crisis, Mydei holds off Nikador alone, giving the rest of the party a chance to return to Okhema and strategize a way to counter this threat.
