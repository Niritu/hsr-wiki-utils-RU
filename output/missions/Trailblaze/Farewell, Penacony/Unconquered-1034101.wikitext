===Talk to March 7th and get ready to set off===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|You wake up in the dreampool and find yourself back in the real Reverie Hotel. According to March 7th, you really have woken up this time from Ena's Dream &mdash; the Stellaron was sealed while you were out, and all the major lineages, except for the Oak Family, are dealing with the aftermath. She also said that The Family has invited the Crew to The Family's Radiant Feldspar as witnesses for an important meeting.<br />High-end cruise ships, luxury banquets... Now THIS is what a celebration banquet ought to look like. What else are you waiting for? Get ready to set off.}}
