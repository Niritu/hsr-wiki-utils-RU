===Interrogate Black Swan===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|As Acheron wages a ferocious battle against the Stellaron Hunter, Black Swan abducts you and takes you before Aventurine. Aventurine expresses his request to you, but you still cannot shake off your shock and the (to an extent) rage at being betrayed.<br />Perhaps you should ask the Memokeeper just what she is planning.}}

===Find Aventurine===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The Memokeeper similarly expresses mistrust of Aventurine, but convinces you that it is for the greater good. You decide to go and see what this truth that he speaks of is &mdash; the truth that could "overturn Penacony."}}
