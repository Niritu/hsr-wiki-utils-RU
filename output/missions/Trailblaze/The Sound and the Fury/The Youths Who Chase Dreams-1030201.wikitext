===Go to the hotel front desk and assemble with the Crew===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|After endless immigration declarations and over a dozen inspections of varying intensity (though it sounds like a quick process, you have been through all of this before and know better), you and March 7th finally arrive at the lobby of the magnificent Reverie hotel.<br />March 7th cannot control her excitement and rushed to the reception desk... You should probably stay close to her.}}

===Speak with Robin===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|Though there were a few complications that made the checking in process a pain, Sunday, the most handsome man in Penacony, and the universally-renowned singer Robin were able to resolve any misunderstandings in time and prevent a further escalation.<br />Robin seems to have something to talk to you about. See what she has to say.}}

Take the elevator and head to your guest room.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|Sunday and Robin assured the Crew in the name of "The Family"... Honestly, was such a small matter worth all of that fuss?<br />Either way, their pleasant attitudes at least showed that the service in this hotel was a cut above. The Crew should have no trouble enjoying their holiday here.<br />As the storm has settled, it's time to retry the check-in process with Miss Alley... Hopefully, things go smoothly this time.}}
