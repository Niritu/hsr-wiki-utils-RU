===Follow Firefly to reach the depths of the Dream's Edge===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dream's Edge|update|Firefly explains this place to you: It is the edge of the Golden Hour, the inner depths of the Dreamscape, and The Family's construction and remodeling zone (in other words, a construction site within the dream). She adds that her "secret stronghold" is further on... The only problem is that "The Family" has eyes everywhere, and you will have to sneak in to get inside.<br />Head deep into the Dream's Edge... As a Nameless, sneaking into a construction site is a piece of cake, right?}}

The only problem is that "The Family" has eyes everywhere, and you will have to sneak in to get inside.<br />Just as your journey begins, it comes to an end as a Bloodhound Family member with a strong sense of principles guards the door before you.
