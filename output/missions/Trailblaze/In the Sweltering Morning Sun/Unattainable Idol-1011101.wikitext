===Go to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone with Serval===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|After avoiding the watchful eyes of the Silvermane Guards, you finally arrive at the entrance to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone. One step further and you will be inside the most heavily guarded military zone in all of Belobog.<br />Will you be able to successfully make it through the gate of the restricted zone? How will you not startle the Silvermane Guards and make it to your destination once you've gotten past the door?<br />To be totally honest, you have no idea. All you can do now is to place your hope in the lady genius next to you.}}

===Trick the guard and get into the restricted zone===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone|update|After avoiding the watchful eye of the Silvermane Guard, you finally arrive at the entrance to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone. The Silvermane Guards here are armed to the teeth and hostile. In comparison, the Silvermane Guards patrolling the city appear to be extremely lazy...<br />However, you notice that they seem significantly less hostile after seeing Serval.<br />Perhaps this will allow you to turn the tide. Give it a try!}}

===Take a look at the restricted zone from up high===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone|update|After avoiding the watchful eye of the Silvermane Guard, you finally arrive at the entrance to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone. The Silvermane Guards here are armed to the teeth and hostile. In comparison, the Silvermane Guards patrolling the city appear to be extremely lazy...<br />However, you notice that they seem significantly less hostile after seeing Serval. With the help of a Landau, no obstacles stood in your way at the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone.<br />You're still not familiar with the area yet. Find a vantage point to observe the terrain.}}

===Find and operate the gear bridge terminal===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone|update|The gear bridge is located in the center of the restricted zone. On the other side of the gear bridge is what Serval described as "hell"... And that is exactly where you need to go.<br />But before that, you must use the gear bridge terminal to connect the two sides.<br />Serval tells you that there is more than just one terminal. Go and look for them in the restricted zone!}}

===Find the energy hub of the gear bridge terminals===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone|update|The gear bridge is located in the center of the restricted zone. On the other side of the gear bridge is what Serval described as "hell"... And that is exactly where you need to go.<br />But before that, you must use the gear bridge terminal to connect the two sides.<br />Unfortunately, all terminals you were able to find don't seem to be working. Looks like you'll have to head to the energy hub that powers them to find out.}}

===Convince the Silvermane Guard watching the energy hub and enter the energy hub===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone|update|Serval brings you to the energy hub, but there is a ferocious Silvermane Guard watching the place.

===Find Silvermane Captain Dunn===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Serval brings you to the energy hub, but there is a ferocious Silvermane Guard watching the place. You can tell his expression even without being able to see the face underneath his helmet. <br />Clever Serval repeats her tricks but is unable to elicit the desired reaction from the soldier... With no other options left, let's try to find that Dunn person that the soldier mentioned. <br />Serval seems to be an acquaintance of the captain &mdash; Maybe it will be far easier than the previous encounters?}}
