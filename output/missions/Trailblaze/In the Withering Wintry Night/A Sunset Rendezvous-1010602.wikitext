===Go outside and take a walk===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|Although this night was not disturbed by the sound of the footsteps of the troops, you were abruptly awakened by the eerie whispers in your dream.<br />You've had the same nightmare for several days in a row. This odd coincidence has made it hard for you to fall asleep.<br />You've tried sleeping in all postures, and forcing yourself to sleep will only cause more frustration... Why don't you go outside and take a walk?}}
