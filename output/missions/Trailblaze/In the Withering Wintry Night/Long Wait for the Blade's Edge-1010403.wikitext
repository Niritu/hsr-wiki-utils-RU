If it weren't for Dan Heng, the three of you would fall for Sampo's silver tongue again.<br />Sampo finally agrees to introduce all of you to Wildfire, thanks to Dan Heng's... persuasion.<br />You have no clue what Wildfire is up to, but judging from word on the street, you have a feeling that Wildfire may have leads on the Stellaron...}}
