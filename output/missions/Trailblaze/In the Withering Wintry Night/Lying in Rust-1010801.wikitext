===Give the supplies to Natasha===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|You come to an agreement: Give Clara half of the painkillers to take back for the vagrants.<br />Even though Natasha isn't the type of person to lose her mind over something like this, you still feel a little bad and troubled...<br />How will Natasha react to this? Guess you'll have to ask her personally to find out.}}

===Meet up with companions and Oleg===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Natasha tells you that March 7th and Dan Heng are with Oleg, the chief of Wildfire. Seems like your companions have been busy with work during your time away...<br />At least they didn't leave you behind and go play hide-and-seek or earn a little pocket money at the boxing gym this time...<br />Anyways, head out and meet up with your companions and see how their work is going.}}

Now, your goals are crystal clear: Do your best in diplomacy with Svarog and if all fails, Wildfire will be ready for battle.<br />To reach your goals, Oleg has arranged a guide for the crew. You probably already know who the guide is going to be...<br />However, the person waiting for you at the designated location doesn't seem to be the dark blue silhouette that you were expecting. Instead, it's some sort of black chaos avatar...}}
