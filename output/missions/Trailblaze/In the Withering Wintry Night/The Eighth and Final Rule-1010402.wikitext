===Capture and interrogate Sampo===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|After the fierce battle, you finally realize who the culprit for putting Dan Heng in this octagon is. Coincidentally, that person hasn't gotten very far just yet.<br />An uneventful pursuit is underway. You swear that if you catch him this time, you will definitely end this opportunist smuggler right where he stands...<br />... Okay, maybe that's a little exaggerated.}}

===Enter the Fight Club===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Hook brings you and March 7th to the entrance of the boxing gym. As you hear the waves of raging cheers through the walls, you are reminded of what Hook said and a chill runs down your spine.<br />What kind of darkness dwells in this shabby building in front of you? It seems the only way to find out is to personally conduct an investigation.<br />You truly believe that it is possible to find Dan Heng here &mdash; after all, you've always thought of him as someone who's had a dark past... But make sure he doesn't know you think that.}}

===Find Dan Heng===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Just as you expected, you find Dan Heng with the same cold and fierce expression in the octagon. Although you've accepted the fact that he's here, you still can't logically understand the reason for it.<br />Anyways, help this companion known as the Cold Dragon Young get through the challenge presented first. The questioning can come afterward.<br />However, being Dan Heng, he'll probably say something along the lines of "I can take them on my own, you know." ...}}
