===Search for traces of civilization in the Snow Plains===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|You land on Jarilo-VI safely, but now find yourselves standing in frigid winds among barren snowfields stretching as far as the eye can see.<br />Feeling stuck, you recall Himeko's words: Successful trailblazers must learn to explore, understand, establish, and connect... Maybe this is what exploring looks like.<br />In any event, your options are now clear: Push through the snow or wait for the Stellaron to miraculously appear by itself.}}

===Investigate the strange snow drift===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Your group has landed on Jarilo-VI safely, but now find yourselves standing in cold wind among barren snowfields stretching as far as the eye can see.<br />Feeling stuck, you recall Himeko's words: successful trailblazers must learn to explore, understand, establish, and connect... Maybe this is what exploring looks like.<br />You are surprised by a wriggling snow drift in this silvery world.<br />What else could be more alluring than a moving snow drift? You decide to approach and investigate.}}

===Follow Sampo and head towards Belobog===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You discover a shivering man who buried himself in the snow drift. If he wasn't looking to take a good nap in the blistering cold then this smiling man is probably trying to hide from something... something other than the few of you.<br />After knowing more about each of you, he offers to bring you to Belobog &mdash; the only human settlement on the surface of this planet. You will most definitely find clues regarding the Stellaron there.}}
