===Rest in the Goethe Hotel===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|After an entire day of sightseeing, you've got a complete understanding of the local culture and are just an appointment at Belobog's Administrative Department away from becoming its actual citizens.<br />You return to the Goethe Hotel. The warm Geomarrow lights and the tea fragrance in the air make you feel at ease.<br />There's still some time to walk around the hotel before washing up and getting ready for bed. It seems like March 7th and Dan Heng also wants to speak with you &mdash; arrange your time before sleeping as you wish.}}

===Investigate the commotion outside the hotel===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|On the first night of the trailblazing expedition, you don't sleep as soundly and at ease as you did on the Express.<br />It's not because you have some kind of close bond with the Express but because you keep hearing the sound of troops moving around as you sleep.<br />And now, you can hear frantic door-knocking &mdash; your instincts tell you that something's not right... Go and investigate.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|After an entire day of sightseeing, you've got a complete understanding of the local culture and are just an appointment at Belobog's Administrative Department away from becoming its actual citizens.<br />It's getting late and not much more is happening on the streets. It's a good time to return to the Goethe Hotel and bring this so-far pleasant day to an end.}}
