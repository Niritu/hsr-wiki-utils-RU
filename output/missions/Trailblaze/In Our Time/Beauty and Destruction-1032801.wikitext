{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|To everyone's surprise, the person present to crown you champion is not Robin at all, but her big brother, Sunday. Here, he finally reveals his true intentions, but he does not seem to want to fight you, instead seeking the possibility of reaching a mutual understanding.<br />He asks you a series of questions that leave you a little lost, but fear not - if you are confounded by Sunday's questions, just look for the answers in your personal experience.}}
