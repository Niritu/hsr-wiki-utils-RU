|summary       = To seal the Stellaron, you decide to pre-emptively enter the Penacony Grand Theater, yet find yourself stymied by the fact the theater has been locked down for rehearsals due to the coming Charmony Festival. Heeding March 7th's advice, you take advantage of the preliminary contests happening at the SoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions, claim the title of champion, and earn the right to enter the Grand Theater early. However, the mastermind behind it all expects this and has been waiting at the end of this journey for quite some time.

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=SoulGlad™ Scorchsand Audition Venue|update|You successfully made it to the SoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions in Scorchsand Hall. Those who dream of becoming huge stars gather here and compete in a ferocious competition in hopes of becoming the one and only "Festive Superstar." As the sponsor of the Festivity Auditions, the entire venue is covered in SoulGlad™ memorabilia: Beverage advertisements and billboards litter every square inch of the streets, and buildings and statues in the shape of SoulGlad™ bottles surround you as far as the eye can see.<br />Unfortunately, this is not the time to be having fun and playing games... Steel your nerves, use all your strength, and think of a way to speed around this SoulGlad amusement park!}}
