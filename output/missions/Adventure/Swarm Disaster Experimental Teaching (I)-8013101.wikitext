===Enter Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Herta, Ruan Mei, Screwllum, and Stephen have joined forces to bring about the Simulated Universe's first major update! The geniuses added a substantial influx of fun content from all their various ideas. Stephen created some Audience Dice to add a bit more spice to this test. According to him, the dice hold "powers" connected to different Paths, and is conducive to ensuring that you meet with the Aeons. Honestly, though, it's hard to tell if he's actually investigating the Aeons... or just trying to make a game.}}
