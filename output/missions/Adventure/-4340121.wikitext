:The package is neither damaged nor dirty, and has its seal intact. Your name is printed clearly in the recipient field on the waybill, with Aventurine listed as the sender. The Interastral Peace Corporation's mark of authenticity has also been carefully made visible on the package.
:You subconsciously let out a sigh of relief, now knowing that this is not a prank by one of those Masked Fools... Though you cannot be absolutely certain either, at least not until the contents of the package are revealed.
:...Oh, whatever. It is what it is. Just open the package.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Open the package.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Play with the coin and try to increase your luck value.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Search the package for more goodies.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perfect! What other goodies will you be able to find?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Gold bars, here I come!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Find out exactly what his surprise is.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (This is... the Astral Express? No, it's actually a miniature model of the Astral Express!?)
