::{{A|VO sideX paidui bizui 107.ogg}} '''"Shush":''' This brings to mind a joke. Someone asked a Nameless: How many names are on your guest list? The Nameless shrugged and said, none, they were all "Nameless."

::{{A|VO sideX paidui bizui 108.ogg}} '''"Shush":''' You mean the Party Car? Yes, it does sound upbeat. It's a pity that the Express is so quiet right now... The exact opposite of "upbeat."
::{{A|VO sideX paidui bizui 109.ogg}} '''"Shush":''' But this might be for the best. If the train were too crowded, our "Party Car" might just become a "Panic Car." Another joke of mine! You can't help but laugh, can you?
:{{A|VO sideX paidui bizui 110.ogg}} '''"Shush":''' I hope you enjoy your time in the Party Car, dear Nameless. We may not be able to get a party started right now, but please feel free to relax and unwind here.

That's when my previous master made the decision to rename it the Party Car.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Actually... Who are you?
::{{A|VO sideX paidui bizui 112.ogg}} '''"Shush":''' I'm merely a drinksmith robot who has been doing his best to provide impeccable service to the Nameless for several Amber Eras.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Were you here all along...?
::{{A|VO sideX paidui bizui 113.ogg}} '''"Shush":''' As a robot drinksmith, my design ensures I remain appropriately inconspicuous. The fact that you don't remember me is precisely as intended.
:{{A|VO sideX paidui bizui 114.ogg}} '''"Shush":''' Should I introduce myself again?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sure. No more than three sentences, please.
::{{A|VO sideX paidui bizui 115.ogg}} '''"Shush":''' I am a robot drinksmith, invented and created several Amber Eras ago by a certain Nameless. My {{Rubi|previous master|Void Archives}} found me in a corner, dusted me off, and has had me serving passengers on the Astral Express ever since.
::{{A|VO sideX paidui bizui 116.ogg}} '''"Shush":''' Oh, that only took two sentences. I'll add one more then. I was named after the last thing Miss Himeko said to my previous master: Shush.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sure. Keep it under 40 words, please.
::{{A|VO sideX paidui bizui 117.ogg}} '''"Shush":''' I am an antique robot drinksmith. My {{Rubi|previous master|Void Archives}} repaired me. I now work in the Party Car, mixing drinks for passengers.

:{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 130.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' See? I wasn't kidding when I said this is the largest room on the Express! You could fit even a Doomsday Beast in here!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's larger than I imagined.
::{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 131.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Right? Even if you put a couple Doomsday Beasts in here, you'd still have room to spare!
::{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 133.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Pom-Pom hopes you aren't actually thinking about keeping those things as pets...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's big, but it's still a storeroom...
::{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 132.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Think of it this way: The more space there is, the more room you'll have to express your creativity!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How could I allow a Doomsday Beast to slumber next to me?
::{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 133.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Oh, that'd be the least of your worries. Even if a Doomsday Beast were here, it'd have to sleep in a cardboard box for now.

:{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 134.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The room is... admittedly kind of messy right now, but so was everybody else's when they first boarded the Express.
:{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 135.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' My room may look pretty fancy now, but that's because I put a lot of effort into designing it myself!
:{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 135.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Ahem! May I remind you that your expenses on "lifestyle essentials" have grossly exceeded your Express Fund budget?
:{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 136.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Carpets, pillows, rocking chairs, and jumbo Pom-Pom toys are lifestyle essentials, aren't they? Hehe.
:{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 136.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Do you really need over 20 pillows, though?
:{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 137.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Of course I do! How else would I have pillow fights?
:{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 137.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' In any case, to prevent such situations from happening again, I must reiterate the rules for accessing the Express Fund!
:{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 138.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Firstly, the conductor is in charge of all resource allocation within the Express. If you need any renovation work done, look for Pom-Pom!
:{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 139.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Secondly, since you're now officially a member of the Astral Express, you must be responsible for your share of duties aboard. Only then can you exchange the corresponding amount of Express Funds for supplies from Pom-Pom.
:{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 138.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Unless you want to sleep in a cardboard box, I suggest prioritizing the renovation of your bedroom first.
:{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 139 m.ogg}} {{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 139 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wait a second. Pom-Pom will provide (Trailblazer) with the renovation funds, then (Trailblazer) will use those funds to pay Pom-Pom for the renovations... What's the point of that? Just get the conductor to renovate {{MC|f=her|m=his}} room directly!
:{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 140.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' This is called procedural justice!
:{{A|VO sideX paidui player 116 m.ogg}} {{A|VO sideX paidui player 116 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' At any rate, I'm now a member of the Astral Express crew, and I even have my own room to boot.

::{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 141.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' And how many times have you said that already!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I forgot that I have my own room now.
::{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 141.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' All I want to know now is... Isn't it uncomfortable to sleep on a cardboard box?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Actually, I just wanted to avoid doing my duties.
::{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 142.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Heh, Pom-Pom knew it!
:{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 143.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' But Pom-Pom also knows that the first step is always the hardest.
:{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 142.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That is why we're here today &mdash; to help you with taking that first step!
:{{A|VO sideX paidui pompom 144.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Pom-Pom has prepared a starter fund to help you kick-start the renovation. You can use it to set up your bedroom!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank you, conductor!
::{{A|VO sideX paidui mar7th 143.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hehe, appreciation is better shown with actions. We're getting that bedroom done one way or another!
