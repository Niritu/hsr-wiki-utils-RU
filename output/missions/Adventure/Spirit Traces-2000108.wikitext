===Discuss the Letter From Locus Silentii with Asta===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|Asta claims to have received a secret letter written by a Cryptologist From Locus Silentii, which not only revealed the whereabouts of the Xenohydro that had been missing for a long time but also tacitly implicates that someone in the space station has been covering up for the escaped Curio. The cautious lead researcher asks you to investigate.}}

The surprise monster attack turns out to be a fabricated pitfall.<br />After a series of failures, you decide to change your strategy and re-examine the Letter From Locus Silentii. You head to the place the letter points out, and you won't miss again this time.}}
