{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|Herta, Ruan Mei, Screwllum, and Stephen have joined forces to bring about the Simulated Universe's first major update! The three planes are now active within the Simulated Universe. At the same time, Herta had the idea to use the Audience Chamber to get you closer to the Aeons faster. Here, using computational data, she has simulated and saved instances of numerous Pathstriders across the span of history. You can imitate them to gain "power" from various Paths. After all, it is only through active practice of piety toward each of the Paths that one draws the attention of the Aeons.}}
