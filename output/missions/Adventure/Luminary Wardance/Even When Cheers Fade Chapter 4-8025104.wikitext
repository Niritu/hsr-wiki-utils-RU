;(Talk to Carmella)
:'''Carmella:''' All the contestants' lounges have been outfitted with such Tactics Board. Luka, you're an experienced athlete. I'm sure you're very familiar with this?
:'''Luka:''' Yep. But Belobog's Tactics Board are a little shoddier than this, not as technologically advanced.
:'''Carmella:''' They're all the same when you use them! Let's use this Tactics Board here to give you a simple brief of the Luminary Wardance's itinerary!
:(Look towards the Tactics Board)
:'''Tuskpir:''' Mehr, mehr! Mehr, mehr!
:Hold the tuskpir in arms and enter the dreamland.

:'''Tuskpir:''' Mehr?

:'''(Trailblazer):''' These journalists really will sensationalize anything and everything. Gotta watch my words next time.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I wouldn't have known if I didn't read the paper &mdash; the ripple effect of this tournament is much larger than I expected.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' This bunch of editors really are clickbait connoisseurs &mdash; each header is more explosive than the last.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' This article is beautifully written. I could almost cry!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Luka should be back at the lounge now. Let's take a walk nearby and look for him.
:'''Carmella:''' Folks, let's take a look at the opponent's profile for the next Faceoff Match.
