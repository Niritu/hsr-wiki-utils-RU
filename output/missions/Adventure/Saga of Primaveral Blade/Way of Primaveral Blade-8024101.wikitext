{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Let us revisit the time when March 7th received a gift from her two young mentors. Accepting the pair of swords made her soar with anticipation as she imagined herself becoming a chivalrous swordsmaster, much like those depicted in immersia.<br />How about taking this opportunity to follow March 7th on her journey of mastering swordplay?}}

:Turning back the clock to when March 7th had just begun studying swordplay...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 101.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Alright, now that you're in position, Miss March, let's get this lesson started.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 101.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I'm not good at acting all master-like. Since Grandpa asked me to teach you swordplay, I won't hold back any secrets.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Thank you so much, masters. Oh, wait, does this mean our training is only officially starting right now?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 102.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' After all, we need to watch you practice for a few days before we can figure out how talented you are, right?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So, how'd I do, master?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 102.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' You're definitely talented, Miss March.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 103 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 103 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey, here you are, (Trailblazer)! Did you hear that? These two masters just called me a swordplay genius.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Indeed. That's our March!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hehe, just wait until I go back, everyone's going to be so wowed by my new skills.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Watch out for the overly generous Xianzhou social niceties, March.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Oh, you're right! I almost got all excited for nothing.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 103.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I'm just speaking my mind. Trust me, you're really talented.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 106 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 106 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Did you hear that, (Trailblazer)? I'm truly a genius!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 103.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Swordplay requires rigorous training. Before we start, Miss March, you need to find a clear reason to keep you motivated while you train. It doesn't have to be something huge, but it needs to be clear.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 104.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' In other words, even though you didn't exactly choose to be our apprentice, you still need to take the initiative during this learning process.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 104.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I once had the honor of learning swordplay from a master. She asked me why I started training at such a young age, why I wielded a sword... So, for our first lesson, I'd like to ask you the same question...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 105.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Miss March, why do you wield your sword?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 107.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Why do I wield my sword...? I wield my sword to take down my enemies! I mean what other reason is there?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 106.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I also questioned that sword master about why she uses her sword, and she said: "...to vanquish my enemies, nothing more." Miss March, you gave a similar response, which shows you've got potential.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There are countless ways to take down enemies.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If you just want to defeat your enemies, you can stick to your bow.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 108.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' "The best way to take down your enemy is with a blaster gun." I heard a hero say something like that in an immersia! He also mentioned that sword training can push a person's physical abilities to their ultimate limit.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 107.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Seems like you've seen your fair share of immersia, Miss March. But if you want my opinion, if your goal is self-improvement, you'll feel just as accomplished even if you put down the sword and go back to your bow.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 105.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Oh, come on, don't listen to his empty talk.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 108.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Oh? Now I'm curious to hear what Master Yunli has to say...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 106.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Let me ask you something, March. Do you have any specific goals for learning swordplay, like achieving a certain ranking in the Wardance? Or maybe you want to defeat someone, like Yanqing or me?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 109 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 109 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Who do I want to defeat...? (Trailblazer)? Dan Heng? Himeko? Or Mr. Yang?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 107.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' ...If you can't think of anyone specific, why not set a simpler goal? Like how many opponents do you want to defeat at once with a sword?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 110.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' "I'll fight ten!"
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 108.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' ...Ten?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 111.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Oops, that just slipped out. It's actually another line from an immersia...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're really into immersia, huh?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 112.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Yeah, I really like them, so what.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Having five enemies on the other side of the battlefield is the limit.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 113.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...I have no idea what you're talking about.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 109.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I think I've figured out what's motivated March to learn swordplay.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 109.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' ...Could it possibly be immersia about swordmasters?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 114.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey, now that you mention it, that actually makes sense!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 115.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I'm super interested in Xianzhou immersia and novels! Even though I use a bow, almost all the great heroes in those immersia use swords, so I want to be a swordmaster too!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 110.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' See?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like you've developed a stereotype about heroes.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 116.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...It doesn't matter. Everyone has their own preferences.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like a great reason to stay motivated!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 117.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You agree, right? I mean, who wouldn't want to be a swordmaster?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 110.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Becoming a swordmaster who fights for justice and battles evil... Well, that's definitely a good reason to keep you motivated in swordplay training.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 118.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Now that you've both given your approval, I have another small request. I want to perform a tea ceremony to honor you as my masters. Remember, you'll need to tap the table a few times with your fingers...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 111.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' ...Tea ceremony? Tap the table? Do we have to be so serious about accepting an apprentice for the first time?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 119.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Please, that's how those heroes in the immersia show their respect...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's just play along with her tea ceremony thing.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 112.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Play along?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But in those immersia shows, they always kneel and bow, right?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 113.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' That's even more unnecessary.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 111.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Let's just stop wasting time. Just treat us to some milk tea, and then we can start our real swordplay training, okay?

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Those who pursue the art of swordplay know to set goals for themselves, for they would have worked toward these goals even if they are never achieved eventually. March 7th's interest in swordplay came about from the Xianzhou's novels and immersia, which nurtured her fantasy of roaming the world as a great swordswoman.<br />To fully play out the role of a swordswoman, she has to first be taken under the wing of a swordmaster.}}

:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 101.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Hey, this is... not how it's supposed to be, right? The Xianzhou is known for its tea culture and hospitality, but you're not treating me like a guest at all! Seriously, am I not a guest?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mengming 101.ogg}} '''Mengming:''' Dear guest...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 102.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Stop, don't call me a "guest." You're not even treating me as one. I want my tea just right, not too hot, not too cold, but the tea you served was either freezing or scalding! Is this how you treat your guests on the Xianzhou? How fantastic!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 103.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Your tea tastes like slop, and you even have the nerve to charge me for it! Are you trying to scam honest folks!?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 104.ogg}} '''Skott:''' And that name, "The Sleepless Earl," it's so hard to remember. How about we give you a new plaque that says "Xianzhou Slop?" It suits this place better, don't you think?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Why is it that guy again?)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Let's just give him a good beating.)
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 122.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Stop! You've gone too far!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 105.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Oh, who's that trying to be a hero?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 123 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 123 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's me! March 7th! Cause more trouble and I'll show you who your mommy is... Wait, that sounded lame... Hey, (Trailblazer), say something for me!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She's March 7th, your ancestor!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 124.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That's right! I'm your ancestor!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She's March 7th, the Sword Champion of the Astral Express!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 125.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That's right, I'm the Sword Champion...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 106.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Never heard of you. Now scurry back to wherever you crawled out from.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yanqing 115.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Mr. Skott, I'm Yanqing, a Cloud Knight Lieutenant. We've met before, and I suggest you stop causing trouble.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 107.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Trouble? Hah! I'm just giving some feedback as a regular customer. The tea here is terrible, and now the Cloud Knights want to stop me from complaining about it? At this rate, who would want to ever come here for tea in the future?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 112.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' A regular customer? You?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 108.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Yeah, what else would I be? The Xianzhou's prisoner?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 126.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Anyway, if you're trying to bully this young lady, you'd better watch out for the weapon in my hand!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 109.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Huh...? Oh, that really scares me! Come on, you're not seriously trying to take my life with that piece of... scrap metal, are you?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 127.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Scrap metal? This is my sword! I'm here to learn Xianzhou swordplay!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 110.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Swordplay? Oh, I get it now. It's just another kind of play, right? That explains why you're dressed like you're in a show. You're not even from the Xianzhou, so why bother learning their swordplay? If you're feeling unsafe, I can sell you an IPC mech.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 128.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Pfft! As if anyone wants your junkyard scrap mechs!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your mechs are only good for show.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 111.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Looks like you guys are totally clueless.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} March 7th can cut through your mechs with a single slash!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 112.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Oh! How marvelous! How about you show me, then?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 113.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Well, guess it's time to show these bumpkins something serious.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's make a bet.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 119.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Oh, come on, how could I say no to a bet?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 120.ogg}} '''Skott:''' So, I can see you're no master yet, March, but I'll play fair. You go back and learn swordplay from your teachers here, and in fifteen days, I'll come find you and challenge you with my mechs.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 130.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Only fifteen days? Alright... fine!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 121.ogg}} '''Skott:''' And if you lose, you'll have to bark like a dog in public and shout, "Xianzhou swordplay is a total joke!" You'll stand at the entrance of Aurum Alley and say it to everyone passing by.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 122.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Oh, and if that's the case, just forget about your master and become my apprentice instead! I'll teach you how to pilot a mech!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 131.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' And... if I win?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 123.ogg}} '''Skott:''' I'll become your apprentice?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 132.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Nah, I don't think so. I don't like you.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 124.ogg}} '''Skott:''' ...Okay, how about this? If I lose, I'll squeal like a pig in public and say, "IPC mechs are a total joke!" And I'll even print that on every mech on the transport ship. Deal?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, he just changed "barking" into "squealing" and that's supposed to be a different story?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Feel like this has happened before...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your bets always sound so childish...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 133.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Squealing isn't enough! You also need to apologize to the owner of the Sleepless Earl, and take back what you said about Xianzhou swordplay!

:{{A|VO side2 baishi mengming 102.ogg}} '''Mengming:''' Yes, thank you all for your timely help. The shop facing a bit of flak from visitors is a minor issue, but Miss March's decision to challenge him is serious... I feel responsible, as if the shop has inconvenienced you.
