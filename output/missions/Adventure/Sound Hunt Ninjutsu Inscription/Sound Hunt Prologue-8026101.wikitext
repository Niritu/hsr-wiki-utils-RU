::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank you. The Trailblazer loves it.
:::'''Robin:''' That's good to hear. The chaos that the Profnana sowed is over, and the true dean has also returned &mdash; everyone can finally bask in their carefree campus lives.
:::'''Robin:''' If you're free, we can do a tour of the school. The facilities used in the party are still being built, but the atmosphere's really lively. It's way different from what you experienced earlier.

:'''Curious Student:''' Here, a picture I just took for you!
::'''Curious Student:''' This graffiti art is so unique. Who did it? What does it mean?
::'''Curious Student:''' Then... I guess that graffiti artist is probably very polite?
::'''Serious Student:''' Let's go invite that person to make a poster for the club event!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where have I seen this...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't this Rappa's style?
::'''Curious Student:''' Oh, you know this graffiti artist, fine monkey friend? How about taking us to him!
::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Talk}} ...Why are we still dealing with monkey friends?
:::'''Serious Student:''' Sheesh, it's just a recently trending meme. Stop being such a stickler.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} ...What's the Ninja Appreciation Society?
:::'''Serious Student:''' Heh-heh-heh, not keeping up with the times, eh? All ninja on stage all need a Void Disguise these days, and the society that trains in the Void Pseudo-Watch-jutsu is the Ninja Appreciation Society!
:::'''Serious Student:''' And the society members, we, are the Void Ninja Watchers who evaluate the Void &mdash; more succinctly known as "Watcher Ninjas"!
:::'''Curious Student:''' This ninjutsu was taught to us by our first generation and eternal society chief. Many are clamoring to gain admission into the society, but none has been approved by us.
:::'''Serious Student:''' Alas, our chief disappeared after the lesson ended, and to this day, no one knows her name.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Does your chief have pink hair...
::::'''Curious Student:''' Woah, our monkey friend knows the chief! Our ninjutsu school is getting quite popular, it seems.
::::{{tx}}
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What activities does your society have?
::::'''Serious Student:''' Hmm... drawing, running our socials, bullet barrage interactions, giving out lottery tickets, and hosting paid streams.
::::{{tx}}
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} ...Internet livestreaming, I'm familiar with that!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Truth be told, I was once a major streamer with millions of fans.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} There are quite a few loopholes with this line...
:::'''Curious Student:''' So, can you take us to this graffiti artist?
:::'''Serious Student:''' I don't know if this person would be interested in the music party...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't think you should look for her.
::::'''Curious Student:''' Tsk, afraid that your society members would be snatched up by the Ninja Appreciation Society? So petty!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...I'll try asking.
::::'''Serious Student:''' Nice, if you have any news, please contact us, the Ninja Appreciation Society!
:::{{tx}}
::{{tx}}
::'''Robin:''' Students now sure have plenty of personality. When I interact with them, I always wonder if I'm outdated.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's pretty annoying...
:::'''Robin:''' But it's all thanks to this passion that the music party is going smoothly.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I love this place!
:::'''Robin:''' Right? It's thanks to this passion that the music party is up and running.
::'''Robin:''' Actually, Paperfold University considered stopping this event. The ruckus that Profnana caused has just been quelled, and it's also the pivotal moment immediately after Penacony became listed. No one really wants any more trouble to arise.
::'''Robin:''' It was the students who submitted their request to The Family, promising that the music party would be a success. It was after many rounds of negotiation and deliberation that the Academy finally acquiesced. This is also why this event is of particular attention.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you make of this?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you telling me all this...
::'''Robin:''' Probably because the party's theme is tied to music, I really hope that this event will be organized uneventfully. The wish to express oneself through melody should not be denied, nor should it be deprived of by matters of the higher echelon.
::'''Robin:''' Music conveys the purest of dreams, and this is the true meaning of Penacony as the Land of the Dreams.
::'''Robin:''' So... do you wish to participate in the music party?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Me? Put on a show? Really?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's time to flaunt my musical chops!
::'''Robin:''' While I look forward to your stage performance, it appears that I may not have that chance this time.
::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What does a band manager do?
:::'''Robin:''' Mainly to organize practice and prepare for the actual performance. Don't worry. The band members have all been confirmed &mdash; they're all outstanding students that the various institutes have selected, and they won't trouble you at all.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} There must be three performances?
:::'''Robin:''' The music party this round will last for quite some time. According to current plans, the central stage will have three performances &mdash; aptly so to maintain the mirth of the school celebration, while also not overly stressing the band out.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} So sudden, I'm a little nervous...
:::'''Robin:''' Don't be. The manager doesn't have to be on stage. They just need to ensure the band's performance goes without a hitch.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why me?
:::'''Robin:''' We've known each other a long time. Of course I'm going to trust in your conduct and capability.

::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Please save this childish rhetoric for your thesis. You should be clear on the valuable import of this music party &mdash; it isn't some hallowed artistic hall, but a bargaining chip in the Penaconian market.
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Only a prosperous, stable and vibrant Dreamscape can attract investors from all over the cosmos. An event ostensibly organized by students is indubitably the greatest exhibition showcase. We cannot miss this opportunity.
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Which is why, I strongly recommend the Fortune Academy's student undertake the task of being the band leader, to control the overall impact of the party.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Please be reminded: This is an academy. A venue that nurtures the elite should undoubtedly be led by the brightest minds.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Grades are the most effective method in gauging a student's ability. The student with the best grade will become this band leader. Such a selection process will not invite any unwanted criticism.
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' Hmph. You dare debate me on music theory, you heap of scrap! This is a bad joke!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...What's going on?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fight! Fight!
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Whoa there, if it isn't the superstar that the kids like? Miss Robin, was it? During the assembly, you were vehemently outspoken on your insistence to organize the music party. Do you have any good ideas?
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' The performing band is a key position. Which institute should undertake this crucial role?
::'''Robin:''' ...
::'''Robin:''' I believe the reasons put forth by every rep are all for the sake of Paperfold University's overall benefit. I hope this music party will run like a perfectly well-oiled machine. In that case, I have a new proposal...
::'''Robin:''' Everyone take a step back, and leave the final decision to this Nameless beside me. How about it?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Huh?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about... deciding with a die roll?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are the merits of music? I'll give it to whoever gets it right!
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' {{MC|f=Her|m=Him}}? I've never seen this person in the school before. Why should we bequeath such an authority to {{MC|f=her|m=him}}?
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' Hold on. I think this person is a stakeholder of Penacony.
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' S&mdash;Stakeholder? Ahem, about this matter... It's not that I'm doubting this stakeholder... but the music party is a longstanding interschool tradition with many complex layers of nuances woven between. There is simply too much context to understand...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Come on, cut me some slack.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you worried that I can't handle it?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Allow me to make it less complicated.
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' No, please do understand. This is an internal student matter, and it should be handled by...
::{{tx}}
:----
::'''Robin:''' Then... For this music party's performing band, the band manager shall be the Astral Express' Nameless &mdash; (Trailblazer). The band leader shall be Ms. Rappa.
::'''Robin:''' Do the academy's representatives have any objections to this?
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' Rappa... C&mdash;Could it be that she is the protagonist of the ''Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions''?
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Approval: This film is Mr. Reca's latest popular work, and the appearance of the lead actress on stage will surely attract more attention.
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Tsk, so be it. It's just a waste of time to continue debating. If a big shot is willing to step on stage, the spectators will be more willing to watch. We naturally have no objections.
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' But I have to remind you, the music party is a huge event for the school. It must be done in a way that satisfies everyone.
::'''Rappa:''' My lord's mind be at ease. I fortuitously chanced upon a secret art related to melody during my ninja training &mdash; the Sound Release ninjutsu.
::'''Rappa:''' As for upholding the repute of my school, it is my utmost duty to champion honor with word and action. Please rest easy.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm counting on you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Now I'm a producer too!
::'''Rappa:''' Yo! Ninja (Trailblazer), how do you do... Wait, I should presently address you as {{Rubi|Sound Master|Band Manager}}.
