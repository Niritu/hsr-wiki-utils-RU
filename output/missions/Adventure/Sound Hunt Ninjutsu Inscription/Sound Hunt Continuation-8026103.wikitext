::'''Dafanchy:''' ...
::'''Czipo:''' Ahh, I can't bring myself to say it.
::'''Rappa:''' You... Is there something that you wish to tell me?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just say it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you all so hesitant?
::'''Arfey:''' {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mr.}} manager, I am so sorry. I thought about this for a long time, but I have to share this decision with you.
::'''Arfey:''' I... I want to disband the band.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You can't just say that so casually.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} A classic storyline...
::'''Rappa:''' Why? Wasn't our last Sound Hunt a huge success?
::'''Arfey:''' After our last performance, I realized that the band's style is way different to what I'm looking for, and there's no chance of that changing.
::'''Arfey:''' The mission that Charmony Academy gave me was to complete a performance at the music party as a band leader. I know that Rappa won't back down, and I have fulfilled my duty as a guitarist, so there is no need for me to stick around here.
::'''Rappa:''' ...
::'''Rappa:''' Ninja Initiate Guitar, do you really truly covet the title of Head Ninja?
::'''Arfey:''' I have looked forward to this performance since the moment I entered the academy. So many famous Dreamscape musicians made their name here, at the music party. When it comes to talent or skill, it's obvious that I am most suited to being a band leader.
::'''Arfey:''' But then you came running out of nowhere and put our performance in jeopardy. You stole my rightful role, and you are going to claim I'm narrow-minded?
::'''Rappa:''' Hmm... I understand your predicament. I see you are a ninja with a clear tenet. You feel that my decisions are standing in the way of that path.
::'''Arfey:''' That's right. You're blocking my path, Rappa.
::'''Rappa:''' But there is one thing I must make clear... A head ninja is not merely responsible for their own tenet, but for their fellow ninja initiates' tenets, too. Your every word has expressed your own hopes, but have you taken your fellow ninjas into consideration...?
::'''Arfey:''' Enough!
::'''Arfey:''' You're still saying weird stuff like that even now? Then you can stay here and play your boring ninja game without me!
::'''Arfey:''' I don't have the time, nor the interest, to put up with your nonsense. {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mr.}} Manager, please forgive me, but I must do this...
::'''Arfey:''' ...I submit my resignation to the band.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're slipping out of this, too?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you serious?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fooled me once, shame on me...
::'''Rappa:''' Ninja Initiate Keyboard, the practice of Sound Release ninjutsu cannot slacken We will need you for future hunts...
::'''Czipo:''' Okay, Miss Rappa! Believe me. I will definitely come back&mdash;
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a dramatic and fun twist.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your band imploded!

;(Talk to Czipo)
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802610305-->)
:'''Czipo:''' I want to become Miss Rappa's disciple! I want to become a ninja!
:'''Czipo:''' Now that you say it... What should we call this ninja band that we're forming? What about "Wave of Chaos"?

;(Talk to Dafanchy)
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802610306-->)
:----
::'''Dafanchy:''' Do you think... that me breaking the rules of Dreamweaver Academy like this is unfair against the other students?
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' The academy will provide appropriate compensation to the other student to make up for not being able to join in with the performance.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Plus, every student has their own stage... She is no exception.
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802610306-->)
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' The truth is clear to see: The student selection representative failed to confirm your identity in time and allowed this whole charade to play out.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' You evidently knew that there had been an error and chose to not report it, taking part in the music party and using up space in the academy's quota. It will be difficult to make a case for your innocence. Before we reach a final decision, your student privileges will be canceled.
::'''Dafanchy:''' I understand. I will honor your decision.
::'''Rappa:''' ...Wait! Please don't be so hasty to make your judgment! Kind, uh... metal master, would you hear me out?
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' What is it you want to say, external student?
::'''Rappa:''' As the Head Dazzling Ninja, it is my obligation to make sure every sound ninja receives a fair judgment.
::'''Rappa:''' Ninja Initiate Bass has always been seriously committed to her training and has never shirked or neglected her duties. Though she is introverted and not gifted with words, she has always treated others with respect and kindness. She is an irreplaceable Dazzling Ninja.
::'''Rappa:''' Therefore, I would ask that you permit Ninja Initiate Bass to immediately return to us and continue her training in Sound Release ninjutsu.
::'''Dafanchy:''' Rappa... thank you.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Allow me to reiterate: The selection for Dreamweaver Academy students is based solely on performance and achievements.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Dafanchy's academic performance has been consistently poor. Furthermore, her internship appraisals are extremely bad, with her receiving constant complaints from employers and never passing a probation period despite entering dozens of internships. What's more, her works in the classroom are constantly classified as illegal constructions period Dreamweaver Association standards.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That is actually pretty bad...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intellitrons can be bad at academics, too?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What does that have to do with music?
::'''Dafanchy:''' The originally selected candidate and I are the same model. Even our production times are the same, so our personal information is almost identical. The only difference is that... She is top of the class, and I am at the bottom.
::'''Dafanchy:''' When the teacher got us mixed up, I went with the flow and appeared before you...
::'''Rappa:''' ...Then, what happened to the original ninja initiate?
::'''Dafanchy:''' I... I spoke to her before. But she said that she was more interested in her current internship than performing, so she asked me to keep substituting for her.
::'''Rappa:''' If that's the case, then what's wrong with letting you perform instead?
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Answer: This process does not comply with selection specifications...
::'''Rappa:''' Metal Master, I was asking Ninja Initiate Bass.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' ...
::'''Rappa:''' There is only one thing that I wish to confirm... Do you still long for Sound Release ninjutsu? Do you still wish to train with me?
::'''Dafanchy:''' I like music! I want to perform on stage! But... I...
::'''Rappa:''' Metal Master! As I can see, there may be an undetected bias within your selection process. Not only does it not help in selecting the most suitable candidates, but it could also serve to damage traditional teachings. Should this be allowed to continue, it will lead to only mediocrity.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Question: What is your proof for making such an assertion?
::'''Rappa:''' My proof? Hah, I will allow our Sound Master to explain that to you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Me?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What did you say?
::'''Rappa:''' Master, your Ninja Prajna Wisdom far surpasses that of ordinary folk. You must have already figured out how to remonstrate Metal Master, right?
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mr.}} shareholder, I would like to know your opinion on the matter.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (I've been put on the spot. Guess I'll have to improvise!)
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Allow me to explain. I have a theory...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} "The trashcan theory"!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' One can see trashcans everywhere throughout their lives, but very few people truly understand their value.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Trashcans may not be the most intelligent, and they may not get the best grades... Their structure may be simple and their appearance basic but, in my eyes, they are...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The most beautiful.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The most kind.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The most artistic.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' A pathstrider of Beauty can see the beauty in even a simple potted plant, and the same goes for a trashcan.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' This theory clearly shows that practicality and value are not equal. Even a mini electronic trash like Dafanchy can achieve great things in the grand and artistic career of music!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} "The theory of regression"!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Only through regression can one's secrets be exposed.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' This regression refers to the convergence of all things back to a constant. If there is an extreme on one end, there must be an extreme on the other to offset it. As they are of the same level of extremity, they should be treated as the same.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' By this logic, the bottom of the class is also the top. There is your proof.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} "The Ninja Code"!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' The ninja world is vast and endless, with infinite standards and laws throughout countless ninja villages. Is it true that a ninja must honor every single one?
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Nay! Ninjas are loyal to their own way of the ninja. If the standards and order of the outside world serve to obstruct our way of the ninja, we will break them and implement our own beliefs!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Therefore, selection standards and examination grades cannot limit a ninja! Only by following their own way of the ninja can a ninja be free to fly like a bird!
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Conclusion: Your logic is contradictory, your argument full of holes, your speech mystifying and nonsensical, and there is no persuasive power to speak of.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' ...However, I can see how important Dafanchy is to you. I can make an exception and allow her to continue performing with the band.
::'''Rappa:''' Really?
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' However, there is one condition.
::'''Rappa:''' Please, tell me. If it is within my power, I shall do everything I can.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Once the music party is concluded, will you be able to apply to the academy for Dafanchy to become an official member of the band?
::'''Dafanchy:''' ...Huh?
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Reason: With her current performance, it will be extremely challenging for her to find a proper job within the dream. Dreamweaver Academy has done all that it can in terms of her education.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's harsh.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's not very nice...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is the job market that tough at the moment?
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Analysis: Dafanchy neither has any interest in the Dreamweaver Academy's curriculum, nor does she have any natural talent. Having seen her performance, it is my belief that the stage is where she belongs.

;(Talk to Arfey)

;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802610304-->)
::'''Arfey:''' You still got something to say?
::'''Rappa:''' Sound training cannot be abandoned like this. Please, follow...
::'''Arfey:''' What do you mean by training? You're the one that needs the most practice!
::'''Arfey:''' Talking about music like it's some kind of ninjutsu and calling instruments "ningu"... you have no respect for the stage at all. I can't believe a student like this is able to become a band leader.
::'''Arfey:''' If you don't like music and just want to play around and get famous, then you should never have joined a band in the first place!
::'''Arfey:''' I do not want someone like you in my band, and I will never play alongside someone like you. Just get out of here!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's not what she wants...

;(Talk to Czipo)
:'''Rappa:''' ...Ninja Initiate Keyboard!
:'''Czipo:''' Oh, if it isn't Miss Rappa and the band manager? Come, let me introduce someone to you. This person here is a Charmony Academy big-shot and former-backing-singer for Miss Robin. We met at the music party yesterday.
:'''Czipo:''' This person here is a Dreamweaver Academy top student. People say they're a master of the Pepeshi war dance. We've arranged to go on a flying car trip tomorrow.
:'''Czipo:''' Finally, this here is the heavyweight finance professional of Fortune Academy! They've already made a name for themselves among the Alfalfa Family, and they haven't even graduated yet. I'm sure, given time...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought you were going on an exchange?
::'''Czipo:''' Oh, yeah, that's right. I almost forgot. It's just... Uhh, I asked the school to push back my exchange dates.
::'''Czipo:''' It's just... well, we've got the music party on at the moment, right? There are a lot of things that I need to take care of personally, and there's just no time to focus on academics. There's nothing I can do. The reward of hard work is more hard work, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You sure have a lot of friends!
::'''Czipo:''' Right? I'm well known at Paperfold University for being popular and having lots of different contacts. Everyone wants to talk to me.
::'''Czipo:''' But being popular isn't always a good thing. I even had to push back the dates for that exchange that was organized for me. Ah...
:'''Czipo:''' I'll let you both in on a secret. I'm really just playing along with these guys. They don't mean anything to me. If I'm honest, my heart is still with the band.
:'''Rappa:''' If that were the case, why were you so intent on abandoning your fellow sound ninjas?
:'''Czipo:''' ...Uhh.
:'''Czipo:''' Ah, I'll be honest with you. Being in a band is all about passion, right? If you're not invested, why would you sit alone in your room wasting dozens of system hours practicing just for a few minutes on stage?
:'''Czipo:''' But... honestly, I'm a little bored. We had so much fun at the Dreamlight school anniversary. Why should I waste all my time messing around in the rehearsal room? It's a performance, so just do what feels right in the moment!
:'''Rappa:''' You are mistaken. All ninja disciples are placing great importance on this hunt. This is not the correct attitude...
:'''Czipo:''' Ah, Miss Rappa... You have your persistence, while I have my enjoyment. If everyone sees things in different ways, then there's no point in forcing us to stay together.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That actually makes sense...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't you enjoy being in a band?
::'''Czipo:''' It's alright. It was interesting at first, but the more I practiced, the more annoying I found it. Passion is a hard thing to keep alive.
:'''Rappa:''' ...Fine, I see how you feel... But, if I could make sound training more fun, would you be willing to come back?
:'''Czipo:''' I'm not sure. That would depend on how fun it would be. What did you have in mind?
:'''Rappa:''' Well, for example, I've seen a very special training method where you use a cardboard ninja helmet to cover your head to achieve maximum concentration.
:'''Czipo:''' But what is the point of being on stage if the audience can't see my face? That won't work for me.
:'''Rappa:''' What about... as you excel with the keyboard ningu, you can help me with some of the responsibility of song composition. You could use this as another way to show off your brilliance.
:'''Czipo:''' Composing sounds exhausting. Maybe that Charmony Academy belle would be into that, but I'm not.
:'''Rappa:''' What about... what about...
:'''Czipo:''' Out of ideas? I'm out then.
:'''Rappa:''' Alright. After this battle is over, I will teach you the true secrets behind my Dazzling Ninjutsu.
:'''Rappa:''' Cosmic Ninjutsu is all-inclusive. There are many schools of ninjutsu besides the ones we use on stage... They are masters of disguise, proficient with seals and talismans, capable of transmitting their voices over great distances, and great at instantly making ramen. There's nothing they can't do!
:'''Czipo:''' I can be a real ninja!? Not just playing around in a band, but actually fighting monsters and saving the world?
:'''Rappa:''' As long as you keep walking in the way of the ninja, anyone can become a true ninja. If you are willing to accept my creed, you could perhaps become an advanced ninja of Paperfold Town, or even... the "Paperfold Ninja Hero"!
:'''Czipo:''' A Ninja Hero... It's not impossible if I think about it! After all, no one can keep up with my "fire squats" in the gym!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Come to the ninja world and master thunder and lightning!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You really believed that?
::'''Czipo:''' Let me ask you. If there was a mech in front of you, and you only had to sing two songs for a chance to drive it, wouldn't you want to try?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You'd have to treat me to Oak Cake Rolls first.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No. I can't drive that mech.

::'''Arfey:''' Rappa is not great with musical theory, so this arrangement is a little complicated for her.
::'''Arfey:''' When we actually perform, it's up to me to keep the rhythm... I'll make a note on the score, so I don't forget.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (The band members are immersed in the world of music. Best not to interrupt.)
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802610310-->)

::'''Arfey:''' ...{{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} Manager, I am so sorry. I should not have said those things to you before.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Apologize to Rappa first.
:::'''Arfey:''' Hmph, it's not that what I said was wrong. Although... she is also pursuing music in her own way.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You were thinking of the band, too.
:::'''Arfey:''' No, I was not thinking of the band. I was simply throwing a fit at not being selected as the band leader.
:::'''Arfey:''' So... that is why I'm unfit to be a band leader.
::'''Arfey:''' The concept of what I recognized as music was far too narrow-minded. I ignored the feelings of the listeners and limited my vision to the academy's internal beliefs. But, I forgot... that music is not just what is recorded in a score.
::'''Arfey:''' Rappa's philosophy is correct... A melody is a record of everyone's view of the world. A chord, moreover, requires people to be united as one. This is not something anyone achieves by their lonesome.
::'''Arfey:''' ...I am quite envious of her. She has never taken any education on musical theory and lives in her own delusional world, but this has allowed her to maintain her creativity and given her the passion to take care of her bandmates...
::'''Arfey:''' Whereas, I am nothing more than an academic, blinded by my own knowledge, led astray by vanity, and left working away behind closed doors in my ivory tower.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's not what I came to ask!
:::'''Arfey:''' Hm? What was it you wanted to know then, {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mr.}} Manager?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did you come back?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How did Rappa convince you to come back?
::'''Arfey:''' Ah... Actually, Rappa came to see me many times after all that.
::'''Arfey:''' She was always popping up in the most unexpected places: In class, in the library, through the windows of the corridors, and even on top of the statue of the dean! She kept telling me about her musical philosophy and methodology. I've never met such a stubborn person.
::'''Arfey:''' She was so serious about music... Perhaps, there really was something I could learn from her. That's the thought that brought me back.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...I imagine that was her plan.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cosmic Ninjutsu &mdash; Persistent Pestering.
::'''Arfey:''' Either way, I was wrong to categorize music as "good" or "bad." I will continue to take part in band events. Please rest assured.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I haven't.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Huh?
::'''Dafanchy:''' Arfey said that she was going back to Charmony Academy to invite her teachers and classmates to watch the performance... I haven't seen her since then.
::'''Czipo:''' Hey, that guitarist hasn't run off for real, has she? Come to think of it, she never actually said that she was going to take part in this performance...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Arfey assured me.
:::'''Czipo:''' Don't forget. It was her that first said she was going to leave the band. How are we supposed to trust such an indecisive person?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You mean Arfey was lying to me?
:::'''Czipo:''' First, she makes us think that the performance will go on as usual, then she disappears when it's time to go on stage... When our audience loses all faith in us, that is when a band truly comes to an end!
