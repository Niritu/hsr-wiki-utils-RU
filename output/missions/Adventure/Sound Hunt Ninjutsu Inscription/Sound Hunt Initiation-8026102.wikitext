;(Talk to Rappa)
:'''Rappa:''' Yo! Sound Master!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yo, Dazzling Ninja Hero!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there still danger here?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you're actually still attending school?
:'''Rappa:''' I have shattered the fiendlings' conspiracy, and Pinecany's long night also welcomes daybreak. The reason I have remained here is merely to collect criminal evidence related to the Evil Ninja Osaru.
:'''Rappa:''' Truth be told, I was to depart soon, but when I learned that the ninja initiates' festival was in jeopardy, this Ninja Hero could not sit idly by.

;(Talk to Fortune Academy Rep)
:'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' As the new owner of the Radiant Feldspar, and a shareholder of Penacony, I'm sure you won't mess up a mere music party, will you?
:'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' We'll leave the upcoming organizational work to you. Just don't become the laughingstock of the entire Cosmos.

;(Talk to Charmony Academy Rep)
:'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' *sigh* Since it's someone recommended by Miss Robin, and a superstar picked by Mr. Reca, that shouldn't be a problem.
:'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' Dear shareholder, the music party is Paperfold University's most important celebration. You all must put in double the effort!

::'''Montana:''' Oh. Lady Rappa of the ''Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions''! It's my first time meeting you... and the Festive Superstar!
::'''Montana:''' No, wait, the trendy way to greet right now is... Yo! (Trailblazer) Ninja, Dazzling Ninja Hero! Trendy Ninja, reporting in!
::'''Montana:''' To be honest, I'd already heard that Lady Rappa would be leading the band, so I volunteered to accept the setup for the central stage. Just ask me if you wanna know anything!
::'''Montana:''' I say that... but what the band has to do is actually pretty simple &mdash; to complete their song performance before the show starts proper.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pom-Pom! Where's my phonograph?
:::'''Dafanchy:''' It's probably... unusable. According to school regulations, the music party bands... must play their own original songs.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} They have to be original?
:::'''Arfey:''' Of course. If any existing piece could be used to complete the show, the quality of this party would be rock-bottom.
::'''Rappa:''' Hm.... Hm. Hm. The path to victory in this battle grows clearer before my very eyes.
::'''Rappa:''' Treading on the stage is akin to stepping onto the battlefield! I am a Ninja Hero, and the audience is the enemy &mdash; success or failure lies entirely betwixt our fingers.
::'''Rappa:''' To attain the most stellar victory, (Dazzling Band/Dazzling Collective/Dazzling Airship/Dazzling Initiate Hotel/Dazzling School Party) must make utmost preparations.
::'''Arfey:''' There's not much time left to practice. Let's tie down the composition.
::'''Arfey:''' According to tradition, the music party's performance pieces are all decided by Charmony Academy. So, I propose that we still...
::'''Rappa:''' Hold it! I don't think this is appropriate. A sound ninja must fervently observe the duty of studying the Sound Release ninjutsu, to transcend the self and rise above the mundane.
::'''Rappa:''' The newly-formed way of the sound ninja's tenets may be arduous, which is why the Head Ninja must rise to the occasion. Therefore, the task of creating the composition has befallen me!
::'''Arfey:''' Hang on, do you know how to compose a song?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yeah, do you?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What other surprises are you keeping from me?
::'''Rappa:''' Heh-heh-heh, I trained with Master Kucha for ten years, and mastered countless trials. Such a meager Sound Release ninjutsu technique is naturally mere child's play.
::'''Rappa:''' It's just that... time has not been a kind mistress, and I struggle to recall that specific ninjutsu. My memory could be jogged if I obtain even the slightest inspiration.
::'''Arfey:''' ...Will you really?
::'''Czipo:''' It's okay, I will! Pretty lady, let me help.
::'''Rappa:''' Sound Master! I beseech you with a request: Could you {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|travel the worlds and collect music compositions for my inspiration?}}
::'''Rappa:''' There may be different Sound Release ninjutsu styles, but our essence is very simple: "Rhythm is a record of the world, not conjured from thin air."
::'''Rappa:''' There are opportunities to train everywhere. I hope you will gain insight during this journey, to better aid me.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds complex...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You sure I'm going to understand this?
::'''Dafanchy:''' I think... what the Chief Ninja means is that music is always around us, that you can take a look around and help her collect inspiration for compositions. That's... probably what she means?
::{{tx}}

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Listen
:'''Arfey:''' You sure this leader is reliable?
:'''Czipo:''' A very interested young lady filled with charm. I've never met such a special student.
:'''Dafanchy:''' She looks confident. There shouldn't be a problem... should there?
:'''Dafanchy:''' At least she's better than me...
:'''Arfey:''' I never should've asked you all. There's not much time left before the first show. We'll talk about this after finishing the school's task.
:'''Arfey:''' I hope she'll be a little more serious during practice.
:After the decision was made, Rappa went off to check out the venue...
:'''Montana:''' ...The Festive Superstar! I have something to ask! That is... can I join you all too?
:'''Montana:''' I overheard everything about Lady Rappa's arrangements. I may not be adequately qualified to become a sound ninja, but if it's about gossip... I mean, I'm excellent at intel gathering work!
:'''Montana:''' Who's dating who among the students, which teacher is being constantly berated by the academy's representative, and who's getting laid off, I've got all that info at my fingertips!
:'''Montana:''' I can ask around for you, organize the information, label their locations... It'll be super convenient for you! Please let me join! Boohoo!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes, I'll do it.
::'''Montana:''' Awesome! I'll post a message in the group now. Just give it a moment. Someone will reply real quick.
::{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry, I prefer to do it myself.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's hard to say.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} She's SSR grade in music.
::'''Arfey:''' Her words hardly even make much sense, and she lacks basic cooperative capability and understanding of teamwork. If she's unqualified but continues to bear the heaviest responsibility, this performance runs a huge risk... Our futures will be affected if we flop on stage.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You must trust your bandmates.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about we cancel the show then?
:::'''Arfey:''' The show's promotion has already started. It's too late to say that now.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The greater the risk, the bigger the surprise!
::'''Arfey:''' ...Forget it. I'll trust in you and the academy, and wait till the first show ends to pass judgment... Just don't expect too much out of it.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's okay. It's fine as long as you can make sounds.
:::'''Dafanchy:''' The bass may not be the highlight in a band, but I still want to play it better.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't worry. I don't know how to play, either.
:::'''Dafanchy:''' Thank you for comforting me. You're the band manager though, you don't have to get on stage.
::'''Dafanchy:''' Before coming to the rehearsal room, I've never even played with friends before, nor have I performed on stage. I taught myself to play from dream bubbles.
::'''Dafanchy:''' Maybe... I shouldn't even have joined the band to begin with.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I mean, you're already here, though!

:'''Arfey:''' We're about to go on. Remember to double-check your instruments. If you're still nervous, just close your eyes and let the music move for you. It's fine even if you play the notes wrong. Just follow my lead.

;(Talk to Excited Spectator)
:'''Excited Spectator:''' Now that's the caliber of a great band! This performance by (Dazzling Band/Dazzling Collective/Dazzling Airship/Dazzling Initiate Hotel/Dazzling School Party) is truly head-banging! It was a delight to listen to!

;(Talk to Calm Spectator)
:'''Calm Spectator:''' The show's caliber was outstanding. Even a seasoned music critic like me had nothing to nitpick.
:'''Calm Spectator:''' If I had to pick holes in it, though... That DJ lady had too much energy...

;(Talk to Joyful Audience)
:'''Joyful Audience:''' You already know I've been watching (Dazzling Band/Dazzling Collective/Dazzling Airship/Dazzling Initiate Hotel/Dazzling School Party)'s performances since they started. I've always been a fan of the band.
:'''Joyful Audience:''' As for Charmony Academy, I wish that bunch of stubborn old coots well. THIS is what real music is!

;(Talk to Mr. Reca)
:'''Mr. Reca:''' Hmm... Such an emotional underscore. If I used it in my film...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mr. Reca?
::'''Mr. Reca:''' Excellent. You still remember me. That means I didn't retrieve the wrong memory when I "redressed" the set.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You haven't left?
::'''Mr. Reca:''' Yes, the set's "redressing" took me some time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Remember to foot the license fee.
::'''Mr. Reca:''' Haha, I won't forget. But whether you remember is another story.
:'''Mr. Reca:''' It's all thanks to the show you guys played that made the new piece such a favorite.
:'''Mr. Reca:''' But I never thought you would prepare yet another superb music set. I would've delayed the post-production if I knew.
:'''Mr. Reca:''' Regardless, my film shooting has already wrapped. I'll leave the highlights at the back to your music.
