;(Talk to Arfey)

:'''Arfey:''' ...*sigh*
:'''Arfey:''' {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mister}} Manager, when you're looking for inspiration for your music... can you please bring me along?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...What's going on?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait, didn't you decide to quit the band?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's with the change of heart?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Of course, it's just that you became a bit unfamiliar.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Remember to wear more clothes.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sure, but it's cold there, so bring extra clothes.
:'''Arfey:''' Rappa has constantly emphasized to me that working together with you will be rewarding. If it's for assessing music, it should be okay.
:'''Arfey:''' Let's not waste any more time and go.

::{{DIcon|Talk}} Let's introduce ourselves.
:::'''Lynx:''' Mm... I'm Lynx, the Mechanical Fever's keyboardist... and a member of the Belobog Snow Plains Research Team.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Aren't you on duty at the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone?
:::'''Dunn:''' ...Ahem. These snow plains may look quite safe, but they still need to be patrolled, in case of any mishaps. The on-duty guard was sick today, so I'm here to fill in temporarily. Yeah, that's the gist of it.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Anything fun happened?
:::'''Lynx:''' Big Sis said you were looking for inspiration.
:::'''Lynx:''' From my experience... when I was stuck, I'd sit in the snow and zone out.
:::'''Lynx:''' Listening to the twigs crackling in the campfire, staring at the white steam rising from the pot &mdash; even the most humdrum occurrences were interesting.
:::'''Arfey:''' Can you really get inspired just from zoning out? I have to seek inspiration from the professor's lectures and analyzing classical works...
:::'''Lynx:''' Sounds really amazing... I've never learned any of that profound knowledge. I just like to play music.
:::'''Dunn:''' Haha, I just sort of winged it from elective courses in cadet school.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} But your band is really successful.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Passion is the most important thing!
:::'''Dunn:''' If I had to recall something interesting that inspired me... Oh yeah, while I was on the way here, something white darted across my path. It was glowing in a strange light &mdash; might be some new sort of new creature!

:'''Dunn:''' Oh, so that's how it was. Nothing to worry about, then. Fragmentum creatures such as these have been pretty lively recently.
::'''Lynx:''' So did you find the inspiration you wanted?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I did.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I suppose...
::'''Arfey:''' Honestly, I never once thought that... such a meaningless record could be used to inspire creativity.
::'''Lynx:''' As long as it's something that can help you create new ideas, that counts as inspiration.
::'''Arfey:''' But... if we don't follow standard music theory, wouldn't we write really strange melodies?
::'''Lynx:''' Mm, I don't really know that complicated stuff. But Big Sis said that the most important thing about being in a band is that the audience is happy.
::'''Dunn:''' Not just that! She also said that the band members and the one playing should be happy too!
::'''Lynx:''' ...You sure remember my sister's words well.
::'''Dunn:''' Ha, haha... Of course! She's the heart of our band!
::'''Arfey:''' ...
::'''Arfey:''' {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mr.}} Manager, we should be heading back to school. I have something... I need to think about.
::'''Dunn:''' Leaving so suddenly? My olms aren't done roasting yet.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Invite them to the performance)
::'''Lynx:''' Sure. I was also thinking of exploring a vast dreamscape. I'll go ask Big Sis about the times later.
