:'''Richie:''' Come, come. Pick your SoulGlad bottle and have a guess: Which soda will spray the highest?
::'''Richie:''' You get a prize for the right answer! The prize is... a Slumbernana Monkey doll that once took the campus by storm!
::'''Gabbana:''' Hey, don't tell me these are left over from the stock you didn't manage to sell. Who'd stan such a dopey, outdated character?
::'''Czipo:''' I choose the fourth one! It's my lucky number!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you all looking at?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me see!
::'''Czipo:''' If it isn't our manager! Come play a round too. No idea what's up with these SoulGlad bottles, apart from the fact that they're spraying soda all the time.
::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Talk}} This is what college students do all day?
:::'''Czipo:''' Yeah, classes are easy, life is cushy, we've got too much time, and we can't have enough fun. We go where the entertainment is.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Isn't it practice time right now?
:::'''Czipo:''' Shhh... I slipped out saying that the room was too stuffy as an excuse. Then I wanted to drink some SoulGlad, and that's how I ended up here.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm guessing...

:'''SoulGlad Idol Group Manager:''' I remember you, at the qualifiers during the official competition. We promised to meet at the top, but none of it came true.
::'''SoulGlad Idol Group Manager:''' Now you are a festive superstar, and we are still nobodies. Good thing I'm still young with a heart that never gives up.
::'''SoulGlad Idol Group Manager:''' Now, we are issuing you a challenge! The SoulGlad auditions' repechage round has officially started!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who are you?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did I agree to your challenge?
::'''SoulGlad Idol Group Manager:''' Ugh. Blast, aren't we archrivals!?
::'''SoulGlad Idol Group Manager:''' We worked so hard to climb our way up the ranks from the qualifiers, but were mercilessly crushed by you in the first round. Yet we didn't give up, and emerged victorious from the loser's group. And then we got eliminated by you in the second stage...
::'''SoulGlad Idol Group Manager:''' But it's different this time! We've improved on our team, and we're back!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} But I really don't remember you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you not at all embarrassed to say you're my archrival?
::'''SoulGlad Idol Group Manager:''' Ability speaks for itself when competing on the stage. We were undefeated in the recent training matches, easily beating all our opponents. Even the audience says we're the "strongest group" they've seen.
::'''SoulGlad Idol Group Manager:''' If you want to prove you're stronger, defeat us fair and square in this competition!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hurry up. I'm very busy.
