::With the Great Lan above, the atmosphere is solemn and quiet. The Dazzling Ninja's brow furrows tightly, her icy ninja power surging forth, condensing the air in the vicinity &mdash; even your breathing is starting to feel difficult...
::'''Rappa:''' Regardless of reason, keeping one's word and honoring promises are the cornerstones of a ninja's creed.
::'''Rappa:''' For Ninja Initiate Guitar to depart without a farewell, retreating from the contest so abruptly &mdash; such an act breaches the fundamental principles of ninjahood.
::'''Czipo:''' Yeah, exactly! We looked like fools on stage. Miss Rappa, I, Lord Czipo, officially ask for permission to set off and personally apprehend this traitorous ninja!
::'''Dafanchy:''' You don't think... something happened to Arfey?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's just head back first.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The band must still perform, no matter what.

::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Eh? Didn't you have four members in your band? One's gone missing? They left?
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Oh no no, if the music party performance ends up being ruined, I reckon the band manager and key members will have to be held responsible, no?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hey, aren't you that spectator just now!?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You sure are passive-aggressive.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Get lost.
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Oh my, as the academy's representative, there's nothing wrong with taking a vested interest in how the campus event prep is going, is there?
::'''Rappa:''' You are welcome to spectate our hunt, but using such hurtful words on my disciples...
::'''Rappa:''' Such behavior is akin to that bunch of despicable, boorish, trouble-making fiendlings working for that Evil Ninja.
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' I&mdash;I have no idea what you mean. We representatives of the academy aren't here to listen to your drivel!
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' Just listen to what you bunch are performing on stage. Is that even music? It's discordant and chaotic... A cacophony on the ears!
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' If Charmony Academy was responsible for teaching such garbage, I might as well admit an automated orchestra off the streets!
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' Hey, you heap of scrap, you say something too. I mean, you're not the trashiest one among us, after all.
::'''Dreamweaver Academy Rep:''' Refusal: I have a prior agreement with this stakeholder, and will temporarily not be expounding any opinion.
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' Hah? You're pretty sly, defecting to the enemy so quickly. A true-blue rational Intellitron. Big-brained move!
::'''Rappa:''' As for these unruly miscreants, we ought to...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Retort with the truth!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm gonna diss 'em!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Being the band manager was never my intention, and everyone here knows it. You insisted I take the role at first, and now you're starting to panic. You didn't want to manage things yourself, and now you want to back out. You can't have it all your way!
::'''Rappa:''' Well said! Allow me to join in the fun!
::'''Rappa:''' &mdash; "Malicious demons prowl the school in nests, and the Dazzling Ninja vanquishes all these pests!"
::'''Academy Representatives:''' ...
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Err, that actually sounded pretty good?
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' Ooh... Arfey, my most prized pupil, I now finally know how you have fallen into such a state.
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Enough. I don't wish to waste any more time with you lot. The matter is simple &mdash; as per the voting decision by the academy's representatives, Rappa and her band are hereby disqualified from performing, and are ordered to disband, effective immediately!
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Paperfold University refutes any previous performances as a representation of the academy, and will prevent you from committing any further reckless behavior.
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' As for the music party, the academy will organize a new band to perform the closing show. Hmph, just wait till you lot get disciplined!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} But I am the festive superstar!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} But I am a stakeholder of Penacony!

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't forget to sign my name when you're doing graffiti.
::'''Czipo:''' Ahh! We're going to get expelled by the school! I've never seen the rep get so serious before. What do we do now!
::'''Dafanchy:''' What the academy's rep is insinuating is that Paperfold University is seemingly dissatisfied with our performance, and intends to change a band. But from the crowd's reaction... I think it's quite obvious everyone loved it?
::'''Czipo:''' Who cares if students like it? The school's preference comes first! Do we have any decision-making powers? Do people even listen to us? We can only wait to get disciplined!
::'''Rappa:''' ...Never! I cannot abide by such uncouth methods!
::'''Rappa:''' My ninjutsu and ninja tenets that I practice may be lacking and require guidance, but that does not give anyone the right to undermine the reason for my efforts.
::'''Rappa:''' A true master will never impose their teachings on their disciples, nor will they judge others according to their own standards.
::'''Rappa:''' The way of the ninja that we practice may only be decided by the ninja themselves.
::'''Rappa:''' Sound ninja, hear me! Will you be willing to join hands with me on a crusade to combat the evil that has befallen this school, to seize justice back from the oppressed ninja multitudes?
::'''Czipo:''' Err... It's game over for us either way, so I wouldn't mind going out with a bang. I, Lord Czipo, will duke it out with Fortune Academy!
::'''Dafanchy:''' Head Ninja Rappa once promised to take me under her wing, and for that, I too am willing to follow you to wherever you wish to go.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Take me along.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've never participated in this group's discussions before.
:::'''Rappa:''' Sound Master! Ninja Initiate Guitar has not returned since, and the enemy number many. I am in dire need of your aid.
::'''Rappa:''' It's decided...
::'''Rappa:''' The Dazzling Ninja will ascend the stage of the final show, to deliver the Ultimate Sound of our performance to the masses!
::'''Rappa:''' I will have that rabble who proclaim themselves masters understand the tenacity of our will, that it will not easily waver before pretenders. This is the Ultimate Hunt for Sound Ninjutsu!
::'''Band Member:''' ...Yeah!
::'''Rappa:''' We have determined our prey &mdash; let us review the trials that still need to be undertaken.
::'''Rappa:''' First: Would Sound Master keep collecting inspiration for our compositions to complete the required Sound Ninjutsu?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Got it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm already a rhythm game master.
::'''Rappa:''' Second: Resist the sinister machinations of those evildoers and secure a window of opportunity for us to take the stage.

::'''Rappa:''' ...Ninja Initiate Keyboard, Ninja Initiate Bass &mdash; will you keep studying Sound Ninjutsu, and organize full preparations for subsequent contests?
::'''Czipo:''' No problem! If we can't find a place to practice, you can all use my house's basement &mdash; it's all top-notch equipment!
::'''Dafanchy:''' Yes, if there's not enough time for composition, I can help out too.
::'''Rappa:''' Also, now that we've learned Ninja Initiate Guitar has been imprisoned by scoundrels, I cannot stand idle as Head Ninja.
::'''Rappa:''' No one member of the Dazzling Ninja will be left behind. I will set off now &mdash; I swear to rescue Ninja Initiate Guitar from the clutches of evil, and return to partake in the final stage!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will you be able to make it back in time?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about my task?

::'''Dafanchy:''' Calm down... What's most important is to gain a chance to get on stage.

::'''Passionate Student:''' He was really insistent, and even used my credit hours to threaten me. So I had no choice but to... agree.
::'''Passionate Student:''' But we never really wanted to perform! A stage that doesn't belong to (Dazzling Band/Dazzling Collective/Dazzling Airship/Dazzling Initiate Hotel/Dazzling School Party) is meaningless.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why not you guys perform instead?
:::'''Passionate Student:''' Never! Instead of disappointing everyone, we would rather watch one more show by (Dazzling Band/Dazzling Collective/Dazzling Airship/Dazzling Initiate Hotel/Dazzling School Party)!
::'''Passionate Student:''' It's settled then! The school should be sending someone over to observe the show. I'll keep a lookout for you guys, but if word gets out, this has nothing to do with me!

::'''Passionate Student:''' That sounded kinda awkward... I'm heading off now. I look forward to (Dazzling Band/Dazzling Collective/Dazzling Airship/Dazzling Initiate Hotel/Dazzling School Party)'s show! We'll be in the crowd cheering you guys on!
::'''Dafanchy:''' Well, that went really smoothly, but...

::'''March 7th:''' Hey, as the academy's rep, instead of intending to stick to your job and teach, you're abusing your seniority and bullying the students. Don't you find that shameful?
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Bullying? When a student commits a mistake and flouts school regulations, it is naturally a teacher's duty to correct it. That is performing one's duty!
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' I can't say the same for your band &mdash; barging onto the stage to perform despite being explicitly forbidden to do so, casting the school in a bad light. Are you going to bear this responsibility if something major happened?

::'''Siobhan:''' I didn't expect that to be the version of the story you folks are spreading outside... whatever.
::'''Siobhan:''' Back to the main point &mdash; I'm also a guest invited to the music party and I really enjoyed the previous performances. I'd like to ask why your school decided to replace the performing band.
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' The band's style does not align with the school's philosophy and is mismatched with Penacony's market needs. Many guests who were scheduled to visit canceled their trips due to the truly unconventional atmosphere of the first two shows.
::'''Siobhan:''' Music is fundamentally about discovering the unknown, so it's natural to have diverse tastes. However, isn't it problematic to place the fate of Penacony on the shoulders of a few students?
::'''Siobhan:''' In other words... Does this kind of thinking indicate that the school has not fulfilled its responsibilities?
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' We can discuss responsibility later. As you can see, that band isn't even performing! They don't have enough members, and if we allow them to continue making a fool of themselves, it'll turn into a scandal for Paperfold University!
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' How is it possible that the band can't even perform at the most important closing show of the party?
::'''March 7th:''' You're the one who locked her up, and now you're blaming us. Can you start making some sense?
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Dear student, did your teacher not teach you the burden of proof? To make an accusation, you need evidence!
::'''March 7th:''' Hmm... Anyways, Rappa promised to be back soon. The performance will definitely happen!
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Smart people don't believe in promises. How about this: I'll walk from here towards the stage. If the band members can get together within this time, I'll allow you guys to continue performing. Is this enough respect?
::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Otherwise, all members are expelled! Do you have the guts to make a bet with me? Or you don't believe she'll be able to make it back in time?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I believe in Rappa.
:::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Okay, remember your decision. I'm going to start walking.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I...
:::'''Fortune Academy Rep:''' Still hesitant? Hmph, I'll take your silence as a yes. I'm going to start walking.

;(Talk to Obsessed Spectator)
:'''Obsessed Spectator:''' This is the spirit of (Dazzling Band/Dazzling Collective/Dazzling Airship/Dazzling Initiate Hotel/Dazzling School Party). Do those representatives of the academy have this spirit?

;(Talk to Fervent Spectator)
:'''Fervent Spectator:''' Can you fully feel the musical allure of (Dazzling Band/Dazzling Collective/Dazzling Airship/Dazzling Initiate Hotel/Dazzling School Party)!!!
:'''Fervent Spectator:''' As long as Head Ninja Rappa gives the order, we will immediately support her as the new representative of Charmony Academy!

;(Talk to Defensive Spectator)
:'''Defensive Spectator:''' Firstly, I am not a supporter of the school. I already graduated long before I saw this performance. But I must say that a teacher's instruction is of utmost importance for their students. In fact, I believe that there's no harm in playing conventional music.
:'''Defensive Spectator:''' I must say, a teacher's views are often more accurate than students'. But I wouldn't insist on this. I only feel that they should be more open to listening to the opinions of the school.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're really only thinking for yourself.
:'''Defensive Spectator:''' No no. It was just a passing remark, just a passing remark...
