:'''Intellitron Merchant:''' ...First beta for a new game. Don't miss out.
::'''Intellitron Merchant:''' Give it a spin. Immerse yourself in a perfect game experience at no cost. It's guaranteed high-octane, 100% assured fun!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Feels like so many games have gone into beta testing recently.
::'''Intellitron Merchant:''' *sigh* Paperfold University is holding a school celebration that has attracted many visitors &mdash; the perfect opportunity to launch my game and make some bank. The revenue generated for this title I developed will definitely be enough for the top spots in the ranking.
::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why can't I find it on the ranking?
:::'''Intellitron Merchant:''' Can't find it? Look... under the rhythm game category in the free games ranking, then choose recent new titles in the anime theme, sort by launch time, and there it is.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Actually, there is a game with a similar theme...
:::You tell him about the Pepeshi merchant, and remember to lavish praise on just how fun his game was.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me play it first.
:::'''Intellitron Merchant:''' Okay, I'll leave the machine here. You can turn it on if you want to play. Don't forget to fill out the feedback form if you've got any suggestions.

:'''Intellitron Merchant:''' Not bad, eh? Innovative gameplay, excellent graphics &mdash; there aren't many high-quality games like this out there anymore. It's really impressive for my first title.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Flawless. 10 points.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Eh. So-so.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can't compare to ''Hanu's Adventure''.
:'''Intellitron Merchant:''' Haha, I didn't specialize in making games before. I was a band keyboardist. I never wrote code, but my composition skills were top-notch.
:'''Intellitron Merchant:''' Back then, I thought having a dream was a blessing. Dropping out of school with friends, forming a band, going on the road playing at various venues... all to seek a chance to step on the grand stage.
:'''Intellitron Merchant:''' ...Heh, I was really dumb back then.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did you give up music?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you changed professions and made games instead?
:'''Intellitron Merchant:''' It's too tough to try to make a living with music. I was really happy playing shows, but life had to go on. It was really cool to have dreams as a kid, but as time moved on, it seemed really stupid to cling to nothing else but dreams.
:'''Intellitron Merchant:''' The band was racking up losses, and life's pressures just became greater. My friends and I finally had a huge row, and I quit the band. I later heard that they couldn't carry on anyway, and disbanded. I wonder what they're all doing now.
:'''Intellitron Merchant:''' ...They're all just pointless stories. You c an listen with a pinch of salt.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you regret it?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' So... do you regret it? Giving up on your original dream for a better life?
