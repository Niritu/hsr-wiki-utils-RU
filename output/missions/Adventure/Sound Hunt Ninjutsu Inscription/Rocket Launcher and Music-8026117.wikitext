:'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' ...New game's first test! Don't miss out!
::'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' Give it a try. Just three minutes and I'm sure you'll love this game just like I do!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Feels like so many games have gone into beta testing recently.
::'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' That's because it's almost time for the Paperfold University anniversary festival. They won't make it if they don't launch now. Not that I'm bragging, but this title I developed? I reckon it can probably clinch a "Most Beloved Mobile Game by Students" award.
::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Are arcade games considered mobile games?
:::The Pepeshi merchant shows you the wheels attached to the bottom of the arcade machine. He even pushes the machine around for a few rounds.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Actually, there is a game with a similar theme...
:::You tell him about that Intellitron merchant and emphasize how fun the other's game was.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me play it first.
:::'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' All right! You look like someone who knows games. Feel free to critique if you find anything lacking. I welcome all feedback. If you're satisfied, please write a five-star review for me.

:'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' ...How was the experience? Was it fun?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It was super easy!
::'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' That's because you were too good at maneuvering. Average players wouldn't be able to hit such a level, really.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't there auto-battle?
::'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' Yes, there can be! We can add anything you want. As long as you have fun, all requests will be fulfilled. As a dev, I will listen!
:'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' Looks like there's decent player feedback. I can now feel at ease. To be honest, this is my first time making a game.
:'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' I may look all prim and proper now, but when I was younger, I also played in a band. It wasn't anything trendy... If I had to be specific, you could call it electronic music. All the wubs and zaps on stage... so cool!
:'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' I really considered music my dream back then. I even encouraged my bandmates to drop out of school together, and fantasized that we can all feed ourselves off band money, hahaha... It was a very lively dream, now that I think back on it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did you give up on music?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you changed professions and made games instead?
:'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' I had no choice. Being in a band was hard &mdash; You need to stay creative, and spend time practising, and network and find a chance to perform, and you still earned no money at the end of the day... *sigh* Don't be misled by the glamor of the stage. We even had to scrimp on hair gel.
:'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' A member later left the band, and then it just disbanded like that. After many twists and turns, I ended up here, starting making games and earning proper revenue. Haven't touched an instrument since.
:'''Pepeshi Merchant:''' *sigh* ...I said too much before I knew it. Don't mind me. Just treat it as a cautionary tale of sorrow from a former band member.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you regret it?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' So... do you regret it? Giving up on your original dream for a better life?
