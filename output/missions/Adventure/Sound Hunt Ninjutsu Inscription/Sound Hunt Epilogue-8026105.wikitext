:'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' Arfey, listen to me, I was lied to by that scoundrel... It was all Fortune Academy's fault!
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' He told me that the school's higher-ups were very displeased with the band's performance, and they would ban you from all music events in Penacony if they continued playing. I was just thinking about your future!
::'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' Here's the music score I copied for you by hand. Take it as compensation.
::'''Arfey:''' Um, I don't need it.
::'''Robin:''' But honestly, the reason the Fortune Academy's representative has been haranguing us non-stop is only because Mr. Alfalfa promised to give him ownership of some stores aboard the Radiant Feldspar, which was instead gifted to the Astral Express, airship and all.
::'''Robin:''' The Alfalfa Family has already rescinded his rep position in the academy. I trust any subsequent events in the music party will not be disrupted.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yeah!
:::'''Czipo:''' Yeah!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is what you get for opposing me!
:::'''Czipo:''' Ho! This is what you get for opposing the sound ninja!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you think... Old Oti has too many relatives?
::'''Robin:''' The truth is the exact opposite of what that representative claimed &mdash; the Dazzling Ninja is a smash hit among the crowd. The school's organizer received loads of fan mail requesting encores of the band's performance and even keeping mementos from the venues.
::'''Robin:''' Penacony's tourism has been on the rise during the event. The proactivity and passion of the students have also quelled the worries of the concerns other worlds had towards the remnants of Order, renewing the Dreamscape's repute among the galaxy.
::'''Robin:''' Thus, Paperfold University has decided to extend the music party's duration &mdash; the student's stage will remain open.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yeah!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} A music festival that never ends!
::'''Dafanchy:''' If that's the case... even students with poor results will also have a chance to perform.

===Return to the rehearsal room{{subst:void|<!--802610502-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Penacony Paperfold University College|update|The closing performance has come to a successful conclusion and your experience with the band is approaching its end...<br />The Fortune Academy representative received their rightful comeuppance. Finally, go to the rehearsal room and see what Rappa might have to say.}}

;(Talk to Charmony Academy Rep)
:'''Charmony Academy Rep:''' I was fooled by that scoundrel... It's all the Fortune Academy's fault! I... I was misled!

::'''Rappa:''' Hmm...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you thinking about?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're not still trying to end with a bang, are you?
::'''Rappa:''' Nay. I am somewhat saddened, is all.
::'''Rappa:''' Even though the contest was unprecedentedly magnificent, every one of you played Sound Release ninjutsu with pitch-perfect brilliance. Alas... all shows must end.
::'''Rappa:''' "All things in this world come and go with neither rhyme nor reason, as if in a dream of dreams."
::'''Dafanchy:''' ...
::'''Czipo:''' Hey, you promised to teach me ninjutsu.
::'''Arfey:''' Don't be such a Debbie Downer. The show may be over, but our band hasn't disbanded.
::'''Dafanchy:''' Even if we graduate, we still gotta jam together!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No, you won't!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Eh? I'm ready to retire though.
::'''Rappa:''' ...
::'''Rappa:''' Everyone has found their way of the ninja. There is no more need for me to continue leading it.
::'''Rappa:''' The Dazzling Ninja is not a group bound or scattered by fate &mdash; it is a legacy of our beliefs. The music will inevitably cease, but the sound ninja's hunt will never end. It is up to everyone to decide the path forward.
::'''Robin:''' Miss Rappa... Are you really thinking of leaving?
::'''Rappa:''' I originally participated in this music festival at your behest, to assist you all in your trials.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So it was a request from Miss Robin?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you weren't just messing around?
::'''Robin:''' ...No. I noticed that some school authorities were abusing their power during the anniversary celebration, but as a guest-of-honor, I could not directly help these students.
