::'''Professor Owl:''' Hoot hoot. New student, you should be careful and not run in the hallway, hoot.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} A new kind of origami bird?
:::'''Professor Owl:''' Hoot hoothoot, I am Professor Owl, a good friend of Clockie's. See the birds in Paperfold Woods? They're all my students.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm in a hurry.
:::'''Professor Owl:''' Hoot hoot. You're still young, with plenty of time. Everything should be resolved slowly.
:::'''Professor Owl:''' Even if Boss Stone were here, there's no need to rush, hoot.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry.
:::'''Professor Owl:''' Hoot hoot, it's all right. What a polite student, hoot.
::'''Professor Owl:''' Hoot hoot. I know why you're in a hurry: It's for our Paperfold Woods' Chirpy Banquet, isn't it? This old bird has heard that you have an important duty to perform this night. How admirable.

:'''(Trailblazer):''' (Origami Birds... practicing? The room ahead must be the classroom... Better go take a look.)

:'''Lead Bird:''' Music is the world's treasure, tweet!
::'''Lead Bird:''' Come on, sing along with soul, tweet!
::'''Lead Bird:''' We are Paperfold University's band, The Chirples! We offer our music to the great Professor Owl. Those who're deaf to music have no right to be talking to us, tweet!
::'''Lead Bird:''' Tweet? Aren't you the one loitering about the stage just now? Didn't know you were one of us. What role are you in your band, tweet?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the guitarist.
:::'''Lead Bird:''' Tweet! The protags in popular band manga are all guitarists. That's unfair to the rest of the band, tweet!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the bassist.
:::'''Lead Bird:''' Tweet! I hate it when fans can't even tell the difference between bass and guitar! Bassists exist too, tweet!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the keyboardist.
:::'''Lead Bird:''' Tweet! Many keyboardists also compose songs. It's super tiring! Everyone should treat keyboardists better, tweet!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the drummer.
:::'''Lead Bird:''' Tweet! Drummers can only hold on to their sticks in group photos, poor things, tweet!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the band manager.
:::'''Lead Bird:''' Tweet! So you're the producer then, scurrying about preparing tracks and venues for the band. Your job's tough too, tweet!
::'''Lead Bird:''' Since we're all mutual music enthusiasts, come play with us! Let's see what you got, tweet!
::'''Lead Bird:''' The band's playing the Dreamville's marching song &mdash; Good Dreams Come, tweet! Do your best to keep up with us, tweet!
