They hope you can help them catch it.<br />What can you possibly do? It's not like you're a member of the Weird-Busters. You've got no choice but to heed the conductor's request, though.}}

===Clear any Memory stage of the Forgotten Hall===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Parlor Car|update|This mirror turns out to be a memetic entity. A messenger from the Garden of Recollection had quietly boarded the Express in the hope of making some kind of deal with you. She says your memory is very precious, and that the Garden is willing to exchange precious materials for it. Doing so requires inducement of memories inside the Forgotten Hall, so that they can be extracted.<br />You've never seen such a complex system packaging as this.}}
