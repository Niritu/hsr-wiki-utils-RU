===Investigate the odd billboard===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|There will always be unexpected items appearing in haunted residences, such as billboards with their backs to the front. Perhaps the journey to penetrate into the depths of the haunted residence should start here.}}

===Investigate the abnormally posted wanted poster===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Sure, Kafka's wanted poster is pretty, but it shouldn't be here. Its appearance in the haunted residence is definitely an anomaly. Investigate it to see what is going on.}}

===Investigate the haunted residence's secrets and continue onward===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Many items removed from the haunted residence are stacked in the small courtyard. Look around, and you might find the clue for your next destination buried within.}}

===Go through the locked gate and continue===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Open the safe and take out the deed===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The deed the landlord spoke of should be inside this safe. Crack the password on the safe, and you will be able to find the deed and complete the mission.<br />Maybe there is some information on the stone monument that works as clues for the password...}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Speak with the heliobus===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Can safes keep heliobi locked within? You know that's not possible. That means this safe is no ordinary box but the owner's retribution to those who wish to pry into their secrets...<br />Ask the heliobus and see what it knows.}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Speak to Sushang and Guinaifen===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|After conversing with the heliobus, you realize that the man calling himself the "landlord" is not as simple as he looked. You should give the deed to him, but he also needs to answer some questions.}}
