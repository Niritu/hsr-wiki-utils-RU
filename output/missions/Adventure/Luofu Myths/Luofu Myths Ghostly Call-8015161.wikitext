===Head to Exalting Sanctum and search for the poster named A-Yue===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|A post on Ghostly Grove concerning phone calls from ghosts catches your group's attention. After Guinaifen sends a private message to the poster, you make contact with a woman named A-Yue, who claims she has been constantly harassed by calls from ghosts. You agree to meet her at Exalting Sanctum, where she will share all the information she has...}}

===Head to Stargazer Navalia to make the appointment on behalf of A-Yue===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|A-Yue tells you about the ghostly phone calls she receives in the middle of the night, and reveals that the other party has asked to meet her at a specific location in Stargazer Navalia. A-Yue going there on her own would be very risky, especially compared to your ghost-hunting squad composed of capable exorcists. You accept A-Yue's commission and decide to meet the other person on her behalf in Stargazer Navalia, aiming to uncover their true identity.}}

===Talk to the peculiar Wraith Warden===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Thankfully, the ghost-hunting squad arrives in the nick of time and rescues Huohuo. Interestingly, the frenzied Wraith Warden has also changed her attitude. Perhaps you can attempt to reason with her? Since there are so many of you here and you all have tricks up your sleeves, you can always resort to force if negotiation fails...}}

===Continue talking to the Wraith Warden to uncover the truth behind the ghostly call===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|It turns out the Wraith Warden has her own hidden stories. Thankfully, she does not dare to stir up trouble. Under your watchful gaze, she slowly recounts the truth behind everything...}}

===Head to Aurum Alley to fulfill the unfinished promise===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|As you suspected, this anomaly is indeed connected to a heliobus who is willing to do anything to break free from its confinement.
