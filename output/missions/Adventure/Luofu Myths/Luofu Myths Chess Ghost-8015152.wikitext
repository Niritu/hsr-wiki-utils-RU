===Discuss with the ghost-hunting squad about the post looking for help===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|You and your fellow ghost-hunters browse Ghostly Grove, discussing which rumors and anomalies might be caused by heliobi. Accurately distinguishing them requires 99 percent common sense and one percent intuition &mdash; some call it intuition, some call it psychic powers.}}

===Talk to the Chess Ghost===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|As you arrive in the streets of Exalting Sanctum, you notice a few people who appear possessed, gathering around a plain-looking chessboard. What an old trick! How inefficient it is to put an unfinished chess game at the side of the road to rob people of their souls? What year is it? Heliobi should really take notes from IPC on how to harvest souls through capitalism.}}

===Defeat the Chess Ghost heliobus===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You accept the challenge from the bizarre heliobus, but this is not a chess game &mdash; how can a Pathfinder challenge count as chess?<br />Regardless, you manage to defeat the enigmatic heliobus.}}
