===Talk to the aged security guard===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|The Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery has been transformed into a security room at the gates of a corporate building, and the Cloud Knight have become an aged security guard &mdash; Qingque's nightmare about getting rich is actually quite ambitious of her. You wonder how you should address her when you meet? General Qingque? Or President Qingque? Whatever. Seeing how long the que is, you decide to skip it.}}

She feels rather... alien to you, but regardless, she decides to offer you a chance to get rich. You certainly can't say that she didn't look after you as a friend.}}
