{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Spade:''' Whoa! I love seeing you hate me and not be able to do anything about it!

;(Floating text)
:Can't help but wanna mess with someone...
:If you don't do something I'll get bored!

;(Approach Spade)
:'''Spade:''' I got you! You fell for it!
;(Spade disappears)

;(Floating text)
:Can't catch me~
:I'm right here~

;(Approach Spade)
:'''Spade:''' You caught me! I&mdash;I'm sorry because I&mdash;I... am not there! Hahaha!
;(Spade disappears)

;(Floating text)
:Hey! I'm leaving!
:...Come on! Come on!

;(Approach Spade)
:'''Spade:''' L&mdash;Let me go! ...I know I was wrong. I'm truly sorry, and I'll apologize to every dog around the world who has ever been bullied!
:'''Spade:''' From this moment on, I will be the protector of all dogs! I will make sure no dog ever cries and will do so until the day I die!
:'''Spade:''' I... I...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want me to teach you another lesson?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this how you apologize?
:'''Spade:''' I... *sob*
:'''Spade:''' Actually... I didn't really do it on purpose. That wasn't it at all... It's just that, well, [[Siobhan]] hasn't been around recently. I thought maybe... if I made a scene, she might come back. Siobhan would come rushing back if the monsters were in trouble. I'm sure of it.
:'''Spade:''' So that's why... I smashed that idiot pooch's thing...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's not a good reason, you know?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You shouldn't have done that, right?
:'''Spade:''' I know... I know... From here on out, I'll be sure to not bother or make fun of that idiot pooch.
:'''Spade:''' "Idiot pooch!" *slap* See how hard that slap was? It hurt so much I'll never forget!
:'''Spade:''' What if, *sniffle*... you let me off this time?
:'''Spade:''' Whoa whoa whoa! I've been miraculously revived!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want me to teach you another lesson?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If this happens again, you'll get slapped ten times!
:'''Spade:''' I'm a good boy~ I'm putting my uninhibited nature behind me~ It's all happy days from here~ Everyone likes dice, haha!
