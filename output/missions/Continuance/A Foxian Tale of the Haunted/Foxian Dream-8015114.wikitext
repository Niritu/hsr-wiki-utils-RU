{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=<!--to be added-->|Huohuo, beguiled by the heliobus, can only searches for traces of Tail in the illusion.

===Find Huohuo's mother===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Within the illusion, Huohuo once more experienced "the loneliness of being abandoned." Despite knowing that it is merely an illusion, she struggles to overcome it on her own.<br />Surely, Mr. Tail's departure has only intensified Huohuo's feelings of being alone.<br />Mr. Tail must do something, such as "bring everyone back."}}

===Defeat the heliobus that has possessed Huohuo===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Someone who is possessed by a heliobus cannot be possessed by another heliobus &mdash; but it is not exact true. To be more precise, Huohuo cannot be possessed by another heliobus while Mr. Tail is covering her. Go. Time to teach a lesson to the heliobus who possessed Huohuo.}}
