===Track down Yanqing's whereabouts===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=<!--to be added-->|update|A Cloud Knight out of control... if it isn't a case of mara-struck, then it would be the work of a heliobus. Following the description in the post, you make your way to the Alchemy Commission to investigate, only to accidentally run into an even more distressing piece of news. The general's retainer, Yanqing, had arrived here and crossed swords with the frenzied Cloud Knight, then left. According to the knight's testimony, a mysterious voice emanated from his own sword and spoke to him.<br />Heliobi are known masters of manipulating others' minds. If they ensnare Yanqing, the consequences would be dire!}}

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=<!--to be added-->|update|After successfully exorcising the heliobus in Yanqing, your next task is to publicize this victory on Ghostly Grove. However, you must minimize the public's perception of how dangerous the incident was to prevent panic, while also trying to stand out online to showcase the ghost-hunting squad's triumph. The task of writing a social media post is not any less challenging than exorcising the heliobus!}}
