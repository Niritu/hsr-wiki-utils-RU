===The Ultimate Hunt! In the quest for Profnana Primon!===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Kingdom of Fiends: Moment of Slumbernana|update|The final Grand Hunt has begun! The ninjas, who have entered the hunting grounds, grasp their ninjutsu talisman tight, and shed blood and tears that they have seen &mdash; It's not just the blood and tears of the Dazzling Ninja Hero, but the blood and tears of the billions of victims ruined by Evil Ninja Osaru! This battle is not fought for ninja honor, but for the vengeance that had covered the very stars in the past, and to uproot the seeds of hatred in the future once and for all! Transform into the arrows of the Great Lan, lighting up the night, awakening those affected, and piercing through the fiendish foes!<br />Awaken the bewildered monkeys and pursue the fleeing Profnana! To the death! TO THE DEATH!}}
