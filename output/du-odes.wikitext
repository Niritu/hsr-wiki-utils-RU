==Secrets==
===Butterfly Perched On A Branch===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Have you ever seen a Butterfly Perched On A Branch, pouring out a love song of beauty and affection?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yes. Animals grow in the footsteps of Kephale, and plants sprout from the hanging branches of Cerces. Yet, upon sudden reflection, none could comprehend their wisdom. The heart of the Reason Titan cracks with sorrow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They wander Amphoreus, collecting the most beautiful scales and feathers from many creatures, creating golden butterflies. Thus began the world's poems of romance, beauty, and love.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Their wisdom could rival Cerces in debate, their sculpting shamed Aquila, and their singing silenced Phagousa. Mnestia, what could be more moving than you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But the butterfly loved in vain.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But the sacred tree did not understand those feelings.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Long companionship stirs the butterfly's heart, so it confesses its love to its creator, but the flustered Cerces flees within the sacred tree. Even when the butterfly weeps blood and dies, Cerces never returns.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Even Thanatos, long accustomed to death, sheds tears for the butterfly. Gathering its fragmented soul, Death cast it into a cocoon. Golden butterflies emerge to pursue romance in the mortal world, while a fragile humanoid form is born from the remains of the cocoon.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Go seek love upon the earth. When the time comes, even the silent tree will bloom for you," Janus guides their path forward.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Go weave romance on the earth. When the time comes, even the tearless god will compose your poetry," Oronyx hands them a golden spindle.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The one in the cocoon departs.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They begin a journey around the world.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They see sheep with offspring wandering the plains, and clusters of humanity singing around the campfire, just as they once did with their creator.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They see children running hand in hand, and young men vowing to sail far across the seas, just as they once did with their mentor.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They see birds carrying fruits to decorate their nests, generals offering flowers to young maidens, their love burning hotter than any Coreflame.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' From one end of the world to the other, they gather all the love of the earth, and their long, arduous journey finally brings them back to their origin.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They connect the broken chrysalis with familial love.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They hang the heart with the love of friends.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They weave the golden cocoon with pure love.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The sacred tree opens their path to kin, their branches intertwining with family and friends. Mnestia gives all of themself to Cerces and finally, within the Chrysalis of Gold, receives the whispers of love.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, the butterfly is reborn from the cocoon, the sacred tree blooms for their lover, and from that moment, they remain inseparable.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Butterfly Flitted Past Window===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Do you know the Butterfly Flitted Past Window, weaving the golden thread of love into this world?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The prince and the neighboring princess eloping, the battlefield-commanding couple, and the forbidden love between humans and the Titans &mdash; all are brought to life by Mnestia's touch of golden wing dust, bestowing upon all beings the eye for beauty and the heart for love.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Love will transcend status.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Love will transcend deception.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Love will transcend all.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila's gaze falls upon a craftsman in Stymphalia, whose machines make water flow uphill and whose chariots climb sunlit hills.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Appearing nightly as a beam of light, Aquila meets the craftsman in secret. Yet, as affection deepens, so does the craftsman's desire &mdash; to meet his lover by day and boast of her beauty to his neighbors and friends.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ignoring her warnings, he holds her tightly as dawn approaches. When Aquila opens their hundred eyes, blazing flames consume him, and a month of unceasing rain follows.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Mnestia's golden butterflies gather the lingering affection, forging it into the craftsman's creations &mdash; creations that chase the Eye of Twilight by day and watch over his lover's sleeping face by night.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} May they embrace under the sunlight.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} May they rest beneath the night sky.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' A young warrior is not felled by battlefield blades but by his friend's envy. The murderer carries the cold body home, feigning grief as he weeps before a maiden.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But Mnestia, riding the west wind of death and night, flies into the maiden's nocturnal dream to expose the man's deceit. She stabs a dagger into her enemy's throat, shaves her hair as a sinner, and becomes a vanguard on the battlefield.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet, the undefeated maiden is never truly alone. A tiny insect always flutters around her, kissing her armor and weapons before each campaign.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' As time passes, hair turns white, and the elderly pass peacefully on their beds. Two beetles cross the battlefield, journeying to the garden of the god of love.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} May sincerity never falter.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} May steadfastness endure forever.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Mnestia, the eternal defender of love and romance.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It drapes an invisible veil over a girl fleeing an arranged marriage, leading her to true love by the sea. It blinds the eyes of a prideful young man, and as all his admirers flee from his sightless gaze, yet one kiss still finds its way to the corner of his lips.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The wings of the butterfly sweep across the sky and earth. Even if the mortal world collapses, children of humanity, do not forsake love brighter than gold!
{{Dialogue End}}
----

===Butterfly Quietly Departed===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Have you heard that the Butterfly Quietly Departed? Leaving only tattered wings behind.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ah, let us speak of "beauty" once more, in tribute to the resplendent eras that stood unshaken. Have you ever been to Paphas? A city that glorifies beauty, where even the esteemed Mnestia once met their match.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The beauty of that girl was extraordinary. Her eyes seemed to hold starlight, and even the prince of Ladon fell into the river from staring too hard. The angered god transformed into human form, competed in a beauty contest, and robbed everyone of their sight to see beauty, while the girl just covered her mouth and giggled.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Great Mnestia, I am not even a fraction as beautiful as you, yet jealousy has robbed you of your beauty."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The god had an epiphany.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The girl smiled.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The shamed Romance Titan, in their flight, flapped their wings, and the scale powder fell, turning apples to gold. Of course, this is just a clumsy justification by poets, merely a reasonable jest when taken as such.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Let's return to Idilia, where a scholar claims to decode true beauty through numbers and geometry, within the temple of Cerces. Using spirals and vertical lines, he charts the shifting paths of the moon and the Thief Star.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Mnestia cannot tolerate such arrogance. They weave a melody of raindrops falling on leafy canopies, the sighs of flowers, and the soft flicker of starlight into silken threads that drape over the shoulders of lovers.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So who won?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it a triumph of knowledge?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Or a triumph of love?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This poses an age-old riddle. If both pans of Talanton's scale were to fall into the water, which would they retrieve first? What constitutes true beauty? Even Cerces, with all their wisdom, struggles to unravel these enigmas.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet, Mnestia knows the answer to the converse question.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' What is ugliness? A world marred by strife and bloodshed, where beautiful garments are ripped apart, grand sculptures toppled, and melodious voices stilled.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Great Mnestia, how might we reclaim the eyes you bestowed upon all beings to perceive beauty, and the hearts that yearn for love?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The wings of the butterfly are torn.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The golden glow dims.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet, the noble Mnestia still tries to flap their wings, seeking an elegant demise, passing the fiery Coreflame to another.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Then, children of humanity, don the golden remnants, transform from the cocoon to butterflies, and bring back the faded beauty of the fallen gods.
{{Dialogue End}}

===When Fate's Fruit Fell===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When Fate's fruit fell, who will take the first bite, creating a world from the void?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In a time older than the oldest, chaos first spawned forth "existence" &mdash; a jumbled mess where fate's threads wrap chaos' nectar, bearing fruit. The primal Coreflame ignites within this fruit.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Janus opens their eyes in the darkness, cramped and suffocated by the threads of fate. They outline pathways with their fingertips, and articulate passages with their words, carving out breaths in the vast void.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' These primordial paths define the boundaries of Amphoreus, still sought by countless souls today.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thus, pathways extend.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Roads and directions are forged.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Prohibitions and closures come into being.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The fruit of fate swells, suspended high, as Talanton breathes softly. Yet, the chaotic black threads are entangled and unclear, slicing through the Titan like blades.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They carve the initial judgment into the fruit's rind, declaring cause and effect, allowing threads to stretch into frameworks that support the world. Where there is cold, there is warmth. Where there is gain, there is loss. Thus, all things can emerge in balance.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' These frameworks become the driving force behind Amphoreus' transformations, causing the light to rise and the heavy to fall.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thus, laws are established.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Rules and justice are engraved.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Judgments and retributions descended.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet the world stands still, as things should morph according to the laws, but the "next moment in eternity" never comes until the third Titan stirs from obscurity.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Young Oronyx, with their first cry, awakens time. The fruit of fate bursts upon ripening, its viscous chaos spilling out, flooding the empty cosmos.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Like a newborn, the world only truly lives after they cry.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thus, time begins to flow.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The past and the future are inscribed.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Forgetfulness and remembrance coexist.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Led by Janus, the three Fate Titans delineate time and space within chaos, bestow laws, and mold the embryo of Amphoreus, laying down the cornerstone for all creation.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It is universally acknowledged that fate is inevitable. But how did the world function before fate was born? What was the original force? What did a chaotic world look like?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Even with the gods' wisdom surpassing that of the mundane, who can unravel such profound puzzles?
{{Dialogue End}}
----

===When Fate's Steps Stalled===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When Fate's Steps Stalled, who walks to the ends and beyond, forging pathways for the deities?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Gate of Infinity carves paths upon the earth, creating walkways through mountains and plains and sculpting riverbeds and valleys for streams.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They guide the sight of Aquila, drawing trails and roads in the sky, enabling the creations of the Eye of Twilight to traverse. The sun rises from the pinnacle of Georios and sets towards the deep, intoxicating seas of Phagousa.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Everything is meticulously ordered.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Everything finds its rightful place.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the Coreflame of Kephale is lit, taking on the heavy responsibility of creating life, Janus gently nudges the threads of fate, which split into two paths before Kephale. If the first path is chosen, they will make beings of strength and intellect, forming a creation more logically complex than the mythical beasts forged by Aquila.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' If the second path is chosen, they manifest as the incarnations of joy and freedom, as boundless as the waves and as ever-changing as the clouds.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet, the Throne of Worlds is not satisfied with these paths. They plead for fate to untangle the ropes, letting the threads fall and entwine around mountains, drift into clouds, or flow along rivers into the sea.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Janus bestows blessings upon the choices of the Worldbearing Titan, stretching forth endless roads.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Each thread is a choice.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Each thread is a pathway.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From here on, life possesses limitless possibilities.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' However, such choices naturally come with costs. Infinite growth of life ultimately invites the compassion of death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, Janus entrusts the threads to Thanatos, who steers the longship along the River of Souls, winding them around reeds and blooms, finally tying them into knots at the ends of the west wind.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Death hands the life knot back to Janus, reconnecting it with reality. Souls then travel these threads, arriving empty-handed in the afterlife.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But guidance isn't always gentle.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Janus too can rage.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They have cut off paths, entangling them into knots to confine Zagreus for the gods. Even the Trickery Titan cannot escape these maze-like doors.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' If they jump, they fall toward the sky. If they run, they sink into the marsh. Only when the omnipotent Kephale shows mercy, or glimpses a secret of the future, do they release the cursed Zagreus after twelve days and nights.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Before the footprints of humanity marked Amphoreus, this great deity had already paved the way. Their prior arrival enables us now to reach them.
{{Dialogue End}}
----

===When Fate Revealed Guidance===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When Fate Revealed Guidance, who quietly follows, seeking the gods' footprints?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Do you still desire to reach the world's end? In the Golden Age before the black tide, find Janus' gates amidst the Endless Sea, pass through them, and you can arrive at every nook of Amphoreus. Only the most devout disciples can open them amidst turbulent seas.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Fearless Akotos is the last warrior to complete his pilgrimage, according to legend. Janus graces his warship, granting him free passage through Amphoreus's skies as long as he does not venture into Aquila's realm.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Only the gods and the cities of the sky priests are worthy to share his view of the world.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Regrettably, you can no longer see that warship. It was ripped apart in the Chrysos War, becoming a meteor in the night sky.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Like a bird without feet.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Like a shattered pathway.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Gate of Infinity, you stand closest to humanity's fate. You call people to your own foothold, to build Janusopolis that connects all, the heart of the world through which all journeys must pass.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Choose the path of virtue over vice, and open the doors of courage rather than cowardice. As people venture forward on these paths, guided by divine mandates, they craft legacies that will endure through the ages.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The priests of Janus hum softly, invoking the blessings of the god. Fish from the seaside states, carrying the scent of the sea, pass through the gates. Northern beasts, stripped of their fur, are loaded onto ships with ice and snow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Janus, the people offer you flowers and milk, extolling your deeds with "prosperity."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yet, eras of abundance can wither.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Gold too can corrode.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the skies start to dim, who else provides guidance for life?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' You witness the tireless messengers. They navigate the mirror-like paths, extolling the Titans by name. Their steps are as light as birds, conveying messages of life and death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The devoted kin who decided to give up their lives severed the ties of fate from the city-states about to fall, causing paths to crumble. As the mist ascends, even calamity finds itself adrift and directionless.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yet, it is better than nothing.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The black tide and calamity are unstoppable.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' No one recalls the last time Janus descended. The land shattered, the seas engulfed and divided. Only the remnants of the earth remain, trapping humanity like caged beasts.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet countless gates remain open to us, offering the last guidance to the world.
{{Dialogue End}}
----

===Carnival of Heaven and Earth===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The banquet has already begun, playing the song of Carnival of Heaven and Earth, celebrating the birth of the Chalice of Plenty.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It is the breath of the first pillar, the Earth Titan. One stream rises with the heat, while another condenses with the cold. Before the sky was formed, it fell as raindrops.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The icy rain startles the sleeping earth awake. Their body becomes a vessel for brewing, and their ears ring with the downpour's roar. They then swear an oath &mdash; the land and ocean shall forever oppose each other!
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Phagousa, spurned by the earth, can only dance endlessly between heaven and land, drinking ceaselessly. Thus, an unending rain hovers over the skies.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The raindrops are their finest brew.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The sound of rain is their laughter.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The rainwater is their divine form.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Only when the Scale of Justice intervenes, asking the land to concede half of their realm to carry the ocean between sky and earth, does the rain finally cease.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Every drop that lands on earth will seep down, evaporate, and flow back to Phagousa's divine realm.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But how can the fickle Phagousa obey an agreement? Waves ceaselessly lash the shores, and the drunken ocean calls to earth to join their revelry, but Georios always answers with silence.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thus, the earth's winds repel the ocean.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thus, the ocean's winds mock the land.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Even so, in the halls of the gods, the banquet never ends.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Fate Titans enjoy gentle brewing. They often bring warnings and guidance to Phagousa. The Eye of Twilight, drunk to stupor, showers the earth with heavy rain, as Phagousa taunts the land.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Kephale drinks steadily. The only time they slumbered slightly tipsy, they nearly had their Dawn Device stolen by Zagreus. Nikador loves the sharp taste of the aged brew, and they always brandish their spear after a heavy drink, challenging their kin to deadly games.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Mnestia flicks their tongue to taste, falling drunkenly into Cerces' arms. Floating on the water's surface is a two-handled jar filled with warm honey brew, drifting with the river towards the end of the western wind.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' You ask about Zagreus? Phagousa loathes them even more than Georios. To trade away the finest brew? Only if they can pull off a trick so clever it makes the ocean burst into laughter.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But the ocean always laughs.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} And Zagreus has plenty of tricks up their sleeve.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Phagousa isn't one to hold grudges for long.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The gatherings of the gods are now distant memories. Looking back, one might dismiss them as nothing more than the fanciful tales of poets.
{{Dialogue End}}
----

===Delight of Rain and Snow===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The banquet reaches its climax, with the song of Delight of Rain and Snow echoing, celebrating the gods' absurd games.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Raise another toast &mdash; for if you can offer Phagousa a treasure unlike any other, they will gift you a honey brew rare beyond imagination.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila gathers a hundred cold breezes, which Phagousa bottles with frost and the echoes of mortal sneezes. Even the Eye of Twilight shivers at its chill. The sky falls into a deep slumber, and snowflakes drift down like fleeting dreams.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thanatos plucks flowers from the edge of the River of Souls, sending them via a butterfly to the shores. Phagousa collects the dew from the petals' edges, soaking the stamens, and the fragrance is infused with the scent of death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Legend has it that Zagreus once stole this honey brew to poison Kephale at a banquet, but the all-knowing gods outwitted them, swapping the golden goblets and forcing Zagreus to reap what they sowed.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The God of Trickery suffers terribly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A curse will torment their Coreflame.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Until Death retracts the punishment.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But in the legends of Dolos, Zagreus simply transformed into a sea snake and sneaked into Phagousa's palace, then drank the gift meant for Death. Since then, Zagreus can also freely traverse between life and death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Sing with the tides once more, for the sea despises silence.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They once sheltered Oronyx, cloaking with endless rain the stars fleeting from the sky. But Oronyx's laughter shone so brightly that not even the deepest ocean trench could hide their light.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When Talanton comes to exact justice, the ocean has no choice but to reluctantly hand over the stars they harbored. As punishment, the ocean will forever mirror the night sky, guarding against the playful Titan escaping once again.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} These are forced explanations.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What bizarre stories.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They once went alone to face Nikador when the savage god was launching an attack on Phagousa's city due to humiliation, but the Chalice of Plenty secretly guided their people to brew divine nectar from pomegranate juice.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "If the city were to fall, how could such finest brew be produced in the years to come?"
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The war of the gods raged on, and few dared to face the spears of Strife. But do not mistake Phagousa for being brave. They merely seized the chance to invite an old friend for a drink, forced to conjure such a ruse before the wrath of an enraged Nikador.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dreadful Strife.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cunning Ocean.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Eternal finest brew.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Look, the dazed Phagousa is still singing. The waves are their drunken laughter, and the whirlpools their graceful dance.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Waltz of Ocean and Winds===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The banquet will eventually come to an end, its melody echoing the Waltz of Ocean and Winds, celebrating the countless pleasures of mortal life.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Who raised the waves before Mnestia taught the disciples what art is? Who taught people to dance in joy and shout in excitement? Phagousa spread the art of brewing to every inch of the land. Was it merely so that someone would join them in laughter at the banquet?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They hide in the drinkers' cups, participating in the ritual made to them along with everyone else. They swallow expeditionary ships, inviting sailors to revel in their belly, and after the humans get drunk, the god spews them and the ships back onto the shore.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Oh, Phagousa, wherever there's a banquet, there you'll be.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Raise a glass, and partake in the ritual.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pour enchanting libations into the sea.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sing and dance to praise the Titan's renown.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But the sea is ever capricious. In their drunken whims, they have overturned warships and cast wanderers onto desolate islands.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' There are also those kins created in half-dreams, molded from coral, reefs, seaweed, and waves. If asked, the Titan has surely forgotten their existence by now.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Some are taller than fortresses, some have two hearts and nine heads, some have teeth that can shatter swords, and tails that pierce stone.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' If not for the many heroes traveling the seas, who knows how these creatures would wreak havoc?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They pierce the monsters' eyes.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They sever the monsters' heads.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They lure the monsters into traps.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The heroes, too, hold banquets on the boat, their feet tapping rhythms on the deck, accompanied by the spontaneous hums of bards and harpists.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, Phagousa mingles among them. Schools of fish swim beneath the ships and oceanic kins board wooden vessels, bringing treasures and sheep to be slaughtered. Honey brew spills into the sea at feasts, inciting the Titan and fish alike to scramble for it.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Sea breezes blow, and heroes stagger, complaining to the dazed waves.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ah, Phagousa, if not for you, where would all these sea monsters and troubles come from? Besides, those treasures were offerings sacrificed to you before our journey!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The drunken god stirs waves.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The heroes lie awake through the night.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Children of humanity, the sea will bless your voyage. So &mdash; even as the black tide swallows the world and the gods descend into madness, do not forget the banquet.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Embark on your hero's journey with song and dance, and meet victory or doom the same way.

===The God Who Fooled Divines===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Caution against The God Who Fooled Divines. Since their emergence, the world has known no peace.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thanatos ripped the earth asunder, swallowing countless souls. Nikador sowed discord, prompting the children of humanity to turn on one another. The majestic Throne of Worlds, wandering in sorrow, wept bloody tears.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Tears hit the ground, turning into droplets. Zagreus, the master of deception, the Coin of Whimsy, embodies duality &mdash; just like the body and its shadow, a smile with tears.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mnestia's most despised Titan.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Phagousa's most detested Titan.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Talanton's most scorned Titan.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They once pretended to be a Chrysalis of Gold in the temple, worshiped by many, until Mnestia flew into it, and they escaped as a shadow. The furious Titan could only curse the blind priests.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They stole Phagousa's crafted vessels at a banquet, provoking a storm from a Titan usually lost in pleasure.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They also concealed Talanton's scales, disrupting the balance of justice on earth. As the weights balancing good and evil fell to the earth, deceit, envy, theft, and plunder emerged, flourishing in their wake.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Indeed, they attempted to steal the colossal machine known as "Dawn," but their fragile shadow was incapable of carrying the weight of the world.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They had to endure divine punishment.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Therefore, Aquila closed their eyes. The omnipotent Kephale shifted "Dawn" to the world's edge, where in the darkness, only Zagreus's ever-reaching shadow marked the trail.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The sinner's punishment lasted twelve days and nights, but would Zagreus' tricks truly cease? The Thief Star in the sky already told us.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It lurks at the year's end, on the last day of the Month of Fortune. Once all Titans have departed, it secretly follows Janus, reversing the guiding paths.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The thief's retribution.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The gambler's rant.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The swindler's complaint.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The gods lost their way for a day, and the world fell into chaos. The calendar now has an extra, nonexistent "Spirit Day," a day of mad scenes such as insects devouring birds and dromases running madly in the seas.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' As for Zagreus? The gods, in their helplessness, bound a star to them.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Whenever they escape from the sky, the falling red Thief Star unveils their path, foretelling an imminent calamity of deception.

===The God Who Teased Mortals===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Beware The God Who Teased Mortals. Their arrival brought relentless turmoil.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The fortune they bring to the world is like a coin &mdash; heads for luck, tails for resignation, reflecting the capricious nature of Zagreus. They delight in seeing the fortunate envied and revel in watching sudden misfortune bring others to ruin.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Hence, even their disciples only turn to them in dire straits, disregarding their boons when luck favors them.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This is Zagreus' retribution.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No one truly believes in them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No one truly loves them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No one truly respects them.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, they meddle with mortals unreservedly.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They bestowed blessings on the city of Marela, turning hair to gold, which, once cut, returned to normal. People bore their golden burdens on their heads until their necks snapped, never willing to shear them off.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They crafted a board game where all could triumph until even the king of Polis gambled away his realm and fled with the board.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In Haerel's mines, they gifted the children there with unnaturally lucky hands for stealing, inspiring priests to teach their daughters pickpocketing and kings to train their sons in the craft of thievery.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Their lies could supplant the truth.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Their fortune could corrupt the purest hearts.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Their schemes could topple empires.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Perhaps they once performed benevolent acts, like concealing a star at the bottom of a lake to drown a greedy tyrant, or unsettling a hero's chariot to help him evade an arrow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But who would place their trust in a schemer more fickle than the ocean? Fate has its Janusopolis, the lands have its Icatus, and even the dreaded Thanatos boasts of Aidonia.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet Zagreus finds no welcome within any city-state.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Of course, the remarkable Dolos is an exception. Enthralled by the exploits of the Coin of Whimsy, they have been engrossed for generations in attempting to recreate grand deceptions.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's akin to an insult to their essence.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Zagreus. How laughable.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps this, too, is a form of faith.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Poets opt to see the Titans as deities enamored with humanity. Even Nikador has safeguarded Amphoreus for ages.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But does Zagreus truly hold any affection for us? If profitable, surely even the downfall of Amphoreus would not hinder their dealings.
{{Dialogue End}}

===The God of Displacement & Chaos===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Exercise extreme caution around The God of Displacement and Chaos. Now that even they have fallen, stratagems pervade everywhere.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Why did Zagreus disappear without a trace when no blade was thrust into their Coreflame? Could this be merely a ruse, a fake-out death to avoid the battles amongst the Titans and the encroaching black tide, thus continuing to stir chaos amongst mortals?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Their kin, the silver-tongued Spirithief Bartholos, still wanders. What secrets did the Trickery Titan confide to it before their fall?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Zagreus' treasure.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The insane truths of the Titans.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nothing but falsehoods.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Behold the Thief's Hand strewn across Amphoreus &mdash; Zagreus has embedded their soul within them. Gather all the limbs, piece them together, and resurrect Zagreus the Thousand Hands, with ten times the power of Aquila!"
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Give me a hundred gold coins, and the generous Bartholos will help you assemble them in the same place. Of course, if you refuse, I might just have to take the coins off you myself."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "In truth, the venerable Zagreus merely slumbers, and we all exist within their dream."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Looking to claim the Trickery Titan's treasure? It's all stashed in the nether realm. Sacrifice your life, and in the domain of Thanatos you'll find gold heavier than mountains."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "That elusive demigod is none other than Zagreus' incarnation. She proclaimed it in Dolos &mdash; since Zagreus never lies, it must be true."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can we align our narratives?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Annoyed, the Spirithief departs. "Old Zagreus' secrets are hidden within their legendary tales."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Legend has it that Zagreus' treasure was spirited away long ago, the thief accidentally killing a deity in his greed. Another tale contends that Zagreus never had any treasure, as they spent everything they obtained just as quickly.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Legend has it that the fallen Zagreus hides in the baths of Okhema, making it easier to steal honey brews from Phagousa's disciples. Another tale claims that Nikador's madness was caused by Zagreus's mischief.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who spun these tales?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Really? I'm skeptical.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nothing about Zagreus can be trusted.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Legend states Zagreus' misdeeds could fill the seas. Legend admits these stories are spun by Zagreus themself.

===War That Never Ceased===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Let us reflect on a war that never ceased, the world's very first war.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the Era Chrysea came to an end in calamity, the strong devoured the weak. A lion's jaws crushed the throat of a lamb, a dagger struck deep into the helpless, and countless corpses flooded the River of Souls, bringing its flow to a halt. Even death faltered, overwhelmed and unable to ferry the fallen.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The mournful pile of bones, crushed beneath the relentless waves, was forged into an indestructible colossus. Rising from the River of Souls, it climbed in a roar onto the land, vowing to unleash divine retribution upon all who were unjust.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Nikador, the conqueror of all conquerors, thus strode across the land with a vow to overthrow the gods themselves.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have heard tales of their carnage against the sky.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Why has Nikador relentlessly pursued the Eye of Twilight for a thousand years? Are they seeking vengeance against the tyrants of the skies for striking down the rebels who dared to reach their heights with their Lightning Spear? Or does the blood-stained warrior aim to challenge the most supreme authority in Amphoreus?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Kremnoans sing that only the fear of the hundred-eyed giant bird, cowering in the clouds, caused Nikador to pursue the Sun endlessly, day and night.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Legends also tell of the day Nikador led their countless kin into the heavens. Lances clashed against lightning spears with deafening roars, and the feathers of gods rained down like a storm of iron.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Phagousa, arriving to aid their ally, transformed the rain into honey brew, intoxicating tens of thousands of soldiers. The enraged god of war set celestial brew ponds ablaze, covering the twilight with burning clouds.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Those clouds still smolder.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The war is far from over.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Why do the edges of the sky seem dim? Those are the eyes blinded by the Lance of Fury.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Foolish poets play their tunes, conjecturing about the covenant of strife and death. Yet they do not know that glory and victory are the melodies of Nikador. The conflict rages on, as they hunt down each kin until none remains unconquered.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, they cleaved Georios' fortress, cast down the stars of Oronyx, and aimed their blade at Kephale upon the throne.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A war of kings.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A war that was meant to end.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Scars etch themselves again and again into the divine bodies of the two Titans, only to heal and reappear, with no victor after a thousand years. Beneath Kremnos, Nikador has descended into madness, while atop the holy city, Kephale remains in eternal slumber.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet the legion of war, clinging to the last vestiges of its glory, still marches toward the distant Okhema.
{{Dialogue End}}

===War That Continues to Thrive===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Let us recall a war that continues to thrive, the precursor to many across the land.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Nikador forged many divine soldiers and inspired those on the earth to master the art of weapon forging.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The first of these was a spear, created during the creation of Aquila by Kephale. The lightning spear thrust into the earth's spine became a gleaming streak that pierced the heavens after tempering by the River of Souls.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Next came a sword, tempered with divine blood after witnessing the heroics of Gorgo, guarded by the braves of the citadel, it became a blade that pointed defiantly at the omnipotent.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The third creation was a shield, gifted by Thanatos and molded from the nether realm's clay, strong enough to withstand furious lightning bolts.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yet, this shield has vanished.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Zagreus, in their vile greed, stole and melted the shield into gold coins, merely to barter for a cup of Phagousa's finest brew.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In an age where divine battles raged incessantly, war made sparks upon the shield. Its fragments became the guarded secret of Castrum Kremnos' defenses. Anyway, these ancient shields can no longer be replicated.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But true warriors do not falter due to a lost weapon. Nikador has never been a coward who hides behind shields.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Nikador brandishes their spear, commanding their kin to align in formation. At their fierce battle cry, the kins charge fearlessly into the fray. Neither the surging waves nor the rolling boulders can slow their relentless advance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} People learned their formations.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} People learned their strategies.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} People learned their bravery.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Just as children learn language and young beasts learn to bite, humans learn to assemble armies, craft chariots, march in formation, and slay their foes.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Imitating the divine battles, the children of humanity crafted wars of their own. The fiercest among them gathered under Nikador, offering their blood in ritual conflict.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' As the god cast their spear, trails of light across the night sky would guide the people of Kremnos. Following the trail of light, they trample every city-state in their path, until they reach the burnt ruins.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} As a festival of praise.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} As a revelation from the Titan.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' At the twilight of the Era Chrysea, no one could recall just how many city-states had once thrived. In the ballads glorifying Nikador, the grim specter of the mobile armed fortresses with a hanging blade became their final nightmare.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The seeds of strife had blossomed into a giant tree, with even the scholars of Cerces learning the knowledge of warfare. From the moment Nikador's imposing form was seen by the people, the unrest never ceased.
{{Dialogue End}}

===War That Lost Its Glory===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Let us revisit a war that lost its glory, scorned by Kremnoans.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Despite widespread criticism and defamation, Nikador was not the mindless brute many portrayed. They held glory in higher esteem than victory itself.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Consider "Barefoot Freto," who dashed from the coastal town of Silo Kossas, his feet as swift as the sea's waves, blessed by Phagousa.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' He challenged Nikador to a foot race, and his arrogance and pride quieted even the Titan. Nikador laughed heartily and struck a deal: If Freto reached Silo Kossas before their army, they would ensure peace for his homeland.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Running is a grand competition.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But no mortal can outpace a god.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Strife Titan set off nonchalantly, while Freto drew his dagger and ended his life. His soul reached his homeland sooner than the Titan, as neighbors besieged his city and the River of Souls overflowed into the fields.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Awed by humanity's courage, the Titan launched their spear, vanquishing the invaders. For the next century, no tyrants dared defy the sacred pact between mortal and god.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When King Desos secretly brokered a ceasefire with Canor only to betray them, leading his forces from Castrum Kremnos to their gates, Nikador unleashed divine fury on their own people for the first time.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Titan positioned at the heart of the conflict. any soldier bold enough to cross the line would find his shield impossibly heavy, his blade shattering and corroding instantly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Titan preserved the honor of warriors.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Titan safeguarded the sanctity of combat.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Titan's kin dismantled Desos' chariot, strangling the king who disgraced warfare, turning his allies into a blood sacrifice &mdash; a stark warning and a ritual to end the conflict.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' War necessitates victory, yet victory isn't its sole objective. Nikador once upheld such order through intimidating force, fostering a fragile yet cherished peace.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} However, glory had long decayed.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' An eternal night shrouds the mortal realm, and the god now devoid of reason sees every life as an adversary. The defender of Amphoreus against the black tide eventually turn traitor and assistant to the black tide, igniting futile wars.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Nikador, resilient as ever, did you ever anticipate such a disgraceful fall from grace?

===Lullaby For Children to Sleep===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Listen to a Lullaby For Children to Sleep, a bedtime story of life and death's inescapable cycle.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It was an epoch beyond comprehension, one we can never return to &mdash; The Golden Age. Predators did not need to hunt and foliage remained evergreen. Thousands of city-states dotted Amphoreus, teeming with beings who knew no sorrow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet the earth could not sustain such a burden. Its backbone shattered into ravines, spewing forth blood that formed rivers, devouring the fallen lives.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' A shadowy arm emerged from the river &mdash; Thanatos, heralding the Era Chrysea's demise with their birth.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From that moment, life became capable of exhaustion.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From that moment, life became capable of aging.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From that moment, life became capable of death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Under the watchful eye of the Scale of Justice, they swore oaths with the gods. The River of Souls marked the boundary, where death would balance life in Amphoreus. Departed souls would journey to the realm of Thanatos, boarding the ferryman's long boat to transition from this life to the next.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They were a friend of Oronyx's. When people were weary from the day's toil, the Veil of Evernight would sway their skirts, making the stars twinkle and calling for their arrival.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thanatos quietly descended into the mortal world, gently brushing the brows of the weary with their pinky finger, guiding them into a peaceful slumber.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The soft hum of the nightingale and the gentle flicker of the stars form a hymn to death and time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dreams carry the whispers of Thanatos.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The evening breeze is the breath of Oronyx.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Only by cherishing this moment can one embrace tomorrow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They once conversed across the River of Souls with Mnestia, as Cerces' divine form was gravely harmed in the gods' wars. Braving the risk of demise, Cerces' partner pled with Thanatos to preserve the fading soul of the Reason Titan.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In exchange, the creations and kin of the couple were offered to Death as a gift. Since then, the realm of Thanatos has flourished with flowers and butterflies.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' As Cerces slept, flowers wilted and returned to the earth, nourishing tender new leaves upon the Titan's return &mdash; reflecting the cycle of souls and the turning of seasons.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is death.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From youth to old age.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From a brief rest to eternal sleep.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Therefore, do not despise Thanatos. They are silent yet gentle.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They watch as people live their lives to the fullest. When the curtain falls, they carefully stir the ferry, softly knocking at the door of our souls.

===Lullaby to Warn the World===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Listen to a Lullaby to Warn the World &mdash; a fable of arrogance and absurdity.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Let us begin with Thanatos' boat. Mortals have always tried to defy death. The mad King Mikas, and Herostratus who hid in a sarcophagus and entered eternal sleep to escape mortality, only became the laughingstock of playwrights. But the most ridiculous of them all was Pylamans of Mythemis.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' He broke reeds from the banks of the River of Souls, weaving them into a raft to cross Death's perilous waters. He ground gold into a dagger to defy decay and disintegration. Following the current of the dead, he sought to assassinate Thanatos while on the boat and usurp their divine authority.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Look, his body remains warm, his dagger still sharp, yet all he finds is a single long boat.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The ferry of the dead.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The boat is utterly empty.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thanatos is nowhere to be seen.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Pylamans leaps onto the boat, calling himself the lord of death. Yet the ferry drifts slowly, carrying him to the other shore.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Then, who wrote this fable? Maybe the Hand of Shadow has a knack for telling strange stories? Over the centuries, there haven't been many fools as crazy as him, but there's no shortage of idiots who've dared to mock death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It's probably a trick. The queen, having heard the rumor, drew upon water from the River of Souls, believing that any portrait painted with it would cause the subject's death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' She sent her servant to retrieve a scoop of the river's muddy waters, secretly pouring it into the king's clay bowl in hopes of killing the lover who captivated him.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But the bowl contained muddy water and nothing more.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The servant dared not approach the River of Souls.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' At a grand banquet, the king unveiled a carefully prepared gift for his lover. The queen was greeted by her own smile painted upon the canvas.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The wine glass shattered, and so did the queen's life. It serves as a warning to all: Do not scheme against others, nor let jealousy cloud your vision.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Finally, let us tell a beautiful story.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The nameless hero was framed and killed, his sword falling into the River of Souls. When the river receded, the sword remained uncorroded. Thanatos called the hero's offspring in a dream, who, guided by the vision, arrived at the sword.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He drew the sword.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He destroyed the traitor.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He avenged his father.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Years later, the young hero, wielding the sword, led his troops to overthrow the tyrant ruling his homeland, driving the blade straight into the center of the crown.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This reminds mankind that death never covers up evil.

===Lullaby to Return Home===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Listen to a Lullaby to Return Home, about the journey to the afterlife.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The tides of the River of Souls corrode ships, turn flesh to ash, and forbid mortal life. They follow death, flooding battlefields and wastelands, receding only after all the deceased are ferried back to the realm of Thanatos.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' If you wish to meet Thanatos, this is where the journey begins.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Step into the cold river.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Accept the end of this life.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Endure the fading of memories.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' On either side of the shallows, you can see countless restless souls drift aimlessly. Some, having forgotten to bring the coin needed for the ferryman, are cursed to wander the shores for centuries. Others, burdened by unforgivable sins, groan in torment after their forms dissolve, awaiting the final judgment.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' There are also madmen abandoned by death, punished for deceiving the Titan, or cursed with immortality after diving into the river. These undying cursed souls linger on the river's edge, begging the god for mercy, waiting for the rare compassion of Thanatos.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ignore them, and you will encounter a butterfly, the messenger of Thanatos, guiding you toward the nether realm.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Follow the butterfly's path.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Keep moving forward.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But beware of Zagreus and their kin. Apart from Thanatos, only they can roam freely in the realm of the dead.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They delight in stealing from the dead. During the bloodiest years of the Chrysos War, gold coins hidden in the realm of death even clogged the River of Souls, causing the waters to overflow into the mortal world. Soldiers scrambled for the gold coins, only to be consumed by the flooding river, leaving a grotesque chapter in history.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When you reach the riverside, Thanatos will have been waiting with the longboat for ages. No one knows their true face, for those who do have already crossed into the afterlife.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They may appear as a bird.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They may show as a dragon.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They may come as a breeze.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They silently extend the Hand of Shadow, accept your payment, and pull you aboard before rowing the oars.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' From this point on, even bards speak vaguely. Some say the heroes gather in the realm of death to raise their glasses in celebration. While others say it is a lifeless place, adorned only with endless piles of bones.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' One way or another, you will catch the scent of flowers carried on the end of the west wind, feel the soul's rain cascade upon you, and finally, as a newborn, open your eyes and let out your first cry.
