==Story==
{{Description|Obliteration swallows the scene before you as you press your ear to the bulkhead, unable to hear their wails in the vacuum. You strike out a target from the catalog. These cursed names hurt your fragile home planet again and again, until it ultimately shattered.<br /><br />First is the Bretaden, who, under the guise of indoctrination, have lured greed to Lott-IX as miners and investors, dividing the nascent land among themselves in a civilized way. Next is the Interastral Peace Corporation, which purchased ninety percent of the planet, bulldozing ancient sanctuaries to erect starports and factories. Lastly, there are the Walkers of the Scorched, who take perverse pleasure in killing, driven solely by the immersive thrill...<br /><br />Turn back the hourglass and trace the contours of the past. Those who have caused you pain must now pay more.}}
