==Story==
{{Description|The spaceship lands silently in Latilanka, a land filled with pain that has only gained a brief respite from war. A screen expands around the stage, hovering in the air, quietly drifting into people's dreams, and awakening the land with morning songs.<br /><br />You are not sure whether this insignificant effort can bring happiness to the billions of masses, but at least the dancing and singing can elicit laughter and soothe their weary souls right now. Through the Synesthesia Beacon, they can encourage attention to kindness, even if it is just a little, and that can heal countless ailments.<br /><br />In the vast universe, all of you are as negligible as dust. However, the joy you gain from the sight of the smiles is much greater than the universe itself.}}
