==Story==
{{Description|When the wings cease fluttering, they stiffen beyond control, unable to be tucked in the carapace. The brain of a tired and aged insect doesn't allow you to digest such a complicated concept, not to mention you are just an ordinary Sting whose lifespan is so short that you do not even reach maturity. Dragging along your dead wings, the memory of your species will tell you where to go. The Afterglow Swarm King urges you to get rid of the food on your tarsi and proceed to your place of birth, but even such a short distance seems insurmountable to a dying Sting like you.<br /><br />In the freezing vacuum, thousands of Stings that are busy flying around suddenly pause their work. They carry you to the destination where you will join the rest of the larvae's food.}}
