==Story==
{{Description|The mining ships have depleted the veins of Ezni-V, leaving the mess to the destitute Shanatans. Condescendingly, they criticize these bloodsucking arthropods, humiliate their ancestors, and mock their misfortune. Ignorance breeds evil, and wisdom nurtures virtues &mdash; people regard this as truth, feeling justified when they plunder everything the ignorant own, including their knowledge.<br /><br />You seize the right to knowledge from the sages and donate it to the ignorant stars. Words and thoughts ripple through the waters. The notion of inferiority is nothing but a lie woven by the evil dragon hoarding treasures. When the fountain of knowledge generously flows across the land, people will realize everyone is born equal.}}
