==Story==
{{Description|In the junkyard linked by gravitational slides, scraps purchased at low prices are arranged in rows in silence, waiting for you to summon them onstage. People mock you for creating meaningless crafts, but the children are enjoying the art of inventing.<br /><br />Old household machines are your favorite components, as they can transform into mysterious guards in the garden with just a few touch-ups. As the magnetic field vibrates, the ore debris on the outer edges bob up and down, reflecting the glow of the blue star and transforming into unceasing drizzle. By piecing together a broken solar sail and some gears, they will become a flower that moves along the wind and never wilts.<br /><br />You send the well-crafted toys to the sky, and you hear laughter coming from the stars. Every curious mind can develop a unique universe.}}
