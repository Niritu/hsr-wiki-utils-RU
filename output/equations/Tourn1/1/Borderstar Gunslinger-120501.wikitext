==Story==
{{Description|Homicides are common in Heldorin. The smugglers hiding in the border star systems carry unforgivable sins of murder, yet they are trying to turn this place into a second criminal haven, to which the authorities turn a blind eye. You hack into their goggles, and your assisting machine shifts sideways and shields you from incoming attacks upon receiving commands. The anesthetic gas permeating the room soon deprives the criminals of their ability to resist, allowing you to accomplish the mundane everyday task.<br /><br />You infiltrate into viscous bioships, incapacitating the glands that are preparing to launch a strike. Wearing an exoskeleton, you charge into illegal memoria trading dens, engaging in close combat with Harbeck mercenaries. These chaotic scenarios of different scales never seem to end.<br /><br />Still, you press on for the peace of Heldorin.}}
