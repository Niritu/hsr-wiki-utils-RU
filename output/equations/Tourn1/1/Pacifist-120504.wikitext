'''Pacifist''' was a 1-star [[Divergent Universe: The Human Comedy/Equatoins|Equation]] in [[Divergent Universe: The Human Comedy]].

==Story==
{{Description|The Karmite army ants, the silicon-eating flowers, and the ever-present Kolchis &mdash; the Hyper-distant Delivery technique not only facilitates large-scale trading of goods but also the migration of countless species. They hide in cargo crates and the sleeves or even the stomachs of the guests, slipping past quarantine checks unnoticed. As a result, clusters of fungi engulf the stars, and the spreading red tide leaves the ocean suffocating.<br /><br />You move between different nodes, following their traces, and racking your brain for ways to eliminate the creatures that do not belong here. The parasitic wild bees infest the ants, and the poisonous rain burns the surface of the flowers &mdash; different situations call for different actions. While it is not too late to salvage the situation, you need to act decisively to nip the problem in the bud and restore peace to the stars.}}
