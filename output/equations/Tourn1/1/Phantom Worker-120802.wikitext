'''Phantom Worker''' was a 1-star [[Divergent Universe: The Human Comedy/Equations|Equation]] in [[Divergent Universe: The Human Comedy]].

==Story==
{{Description|It is a warm world with massive globular masses of gas, within which numerous consumable items float or fly. You adore the soft organs that can slide down your throat without chewing, and you also fancy the hard bones that make a crunchy sound when you bite them. Because of your genetic instincts, you resist the urge to feast on the food &mdash; the scholars call it the wisdom of Swarm, of which you are unaware.<br /><br />You inflate your abdomen, and glands appear at the spot where the stinger is supposed to be. You mix your location and scent in the secretion, and can't help adding some hunger into it before squirting it out. The wind in the universe will then carry the pheromones of the Phantom Swarm King around until they reach the antennae of its peers.}}
