==Story==
{{Description|You have lost something very important. It is as though a skilled thief in your brain silently stole your past, ruthlessly digging a hole in your heart. The Cremators, the Holstein Aphasia &mdash; you have heard these names before, but never envisioned their presence to be so near. They cut off half of your soul and treat those memories as scrap.<br /><br />Who could tolerate cherished memories being discarded so casually? You trace their shadows, embarking on a quest for wrathful vengeance. No one has control over the memories of others. You are set to reclaim your story, even if it has been callously cremated already. You will seize the merciless thieves and make them pay for their arrogant behavior.}}
