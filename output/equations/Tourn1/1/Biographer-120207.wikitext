==Story==
{{Description|Do you like listening to stories? The thrilling adventures and epic love stories of others are akin to the stalactites in a cave, as they are invaluable treasures formed by the drip of memories. An elderly lady lets out a guffaw &mdash; she was once hit by a meteor rain during her voyage in the Unicorn Nebula but ran into a long-lost friend on the rescue ship. A general is in tears &mdash; his fleet suffered a crushing defeat in the deciding battle in the Yellow Citrus Nebula due to his erroneous judgment. Having lost three arms, he also can no longer fly with his huge scale wings. You write down their stories, laughing and crying along with them.<br /><br />Who doesn't know you? You're a biographer from New Londinium. Shush, listen carefully &mdash; the next story is coming.}}
