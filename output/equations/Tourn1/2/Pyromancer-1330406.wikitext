==Story==
{{Description|Toxins accumulate in the heart, while abominations parasitize the arms, leaving you to witness countless incurable ailments where patients writhe in agony, unable to find solace even in sleep. Some afflictions are embedded in their very genes, and removing them would compromise the integrity of the immune system. Others become entwined with the patient's survival. Once they're cured, the host can never live.<br /><br />You incinerate the root cause of disease along with its carriers, prescribing a potent remedy known as "No Pain, No Gain." In an instant, the heat sublimates the sickly and unsalvageable heart, while the beam of energy obliterates the arm wrapped in twisted branches and leaves. Destruction stands as the natural enemy of all illnesses. Once burned in the flames, even the most grotesque viruses have nowhere to hide. You stare as the flames forge new a vessal for the patient &mdash; a pure antimatter body, born anew.}}
