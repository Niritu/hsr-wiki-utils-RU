'''Disaster-Halting Mechanism''' was a 2-star [[Divergent Universe: The Human Comedy/Equatoins|Equation]] in [[Divergent Universe: The Human Comedy]].

==Story==
{{Description|The aging of celestial bodies, the Swarm suffering from famine, and the wandering silicon-eating bacteria &mdash; disasters take place in the universe all the time. Even though the Omen Vanguards are doing their best to help with the Finality's guidance, they hardly have the capacity to attend to all the disasters that strike at unexpected times.<br /><br />You traverse the universe, collecting data of the future from the subtle changes, searching for the tragic end that is about to be born. Even acting a second before the disaster's arrival can save countless lives. You divert the neutral particle stream from the Cauro Nova explosion away using the magnetic fields, and blast the Swarm when it is halfway through its journey to help the evacuation of Linda-III's residents. Where there's a will, there's a way, and no fate is set in stone.<br /><br />You are always on the move, just to get the upper hand in the battle against death, where time is of the essence.}}
