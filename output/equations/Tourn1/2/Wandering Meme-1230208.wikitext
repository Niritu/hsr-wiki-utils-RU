==Story==
{{Description|There is a word that even the wealthiest merchants of Pier Point will happily drop into a joke to lighten the air. There is a story that spreads throughout the Aether Network, and hackers happily talk about it before spreading it far and wide throughout the universe.<br /><br />You cast aside your cumbersome body and compile all of your information into a meme. Whenever someone taps to play, a new copy of you is born in their language center. Their brain decodes modern slang and stores it in their data, where a new self takes root in their cognition. Like a worm attached onto words and jokes, it crawls along the trails of the Synesthesia Beacon towards the conscious being that accepted the infection.<br /><br />There is a meme that lurks within the fashionable, swims in the current of the popular, and silently becomes a parasite in the memories of humankind.}}
