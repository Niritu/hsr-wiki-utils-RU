==Story==
{{Description|Do you know Pathestion of Enoepus? Poor warrior.<br />That expedition consumed his soul, leaving no space even for tears.<br />He was such a proud man! Mnestia's prophecy foretold that<br />He would avenge his father in golden armor<br />And wed the unvanquishable war maiden.<br />Yet, upon his return, the pack on his shoulders, laden with bones, emitted a haunting rattle.<br />The man never slept after his return, silently sowing the shattered bones into the fields.<br />He guarded them night and day, awaiting the harvest.<br />He painted a vivid picture of that "beautiful" scene for me, but I scurried away in haste.<br />Much like the alchemy practiced in Nousporism, soil and soul are attached to bones.<br />Perhaps he truly could grow something from them...}}
