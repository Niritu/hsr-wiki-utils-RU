==Story==
{{Description|Greetings, bard. Would you like to join us?<br />Cerces came to the world in the form of the tree, bearing her wisdom in its roots and fruits.<br />What is healing, and what is harm? Only the wise can tell the difference.<br />The gods tempt the world with sweetness &mdash; though necessary, it causes decay when taken in excess.<br />They also test people with bitterness. To reach the truth,<br />one must keep a balanced diet.<br />Simple meals, though unsavory, make our bodies healthy,<br />While indulgence and gluttony bring fleeting pleasure but a lifetime in ruins. A violation of the order of nature.<br />The plants in the herb garden grow with sunlight and rain.<br />So do we too. Just like tender shoots emerging from the soil, if we overtake, our roots will rot.}}
