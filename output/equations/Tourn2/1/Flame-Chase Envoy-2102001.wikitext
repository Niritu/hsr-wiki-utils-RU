==Story==
{{Description|Let me tell you about a group of footless birds, the unkillable eagles of the battlefield.<br />When the hero who ripped the skies and the demigod who brought the prophecy sent word,<br />There was an unstoppable calamity and the courage to reshape the world.<br />In the name of Empress Cerydra, ancient messengers passed through Janus's gates.<br />They traveled to Ladon, Handak, and every city-state,<br />Connecting the shattered lands and announcing the beginning of the Flame-Chase.<br />Then, they were decapitated by the most foolish kings.<br />They traveled to Icatus, Kadir, and every battlefield,<br />Bringing weapons to the heroes and messages to the wise.<br />Till the final god is slain, or till our very last drop of blood is shed.}}
