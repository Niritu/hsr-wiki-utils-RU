==Story==
{{Description|Let me tell you about those enigmatic priests, who weave the whispers of time with their prayers.<br />The miracles wrought by Oronyx can reforge even the most shattered memories.<br />Rivers retreat, and crumbling walls unveil weathered inscriptions.<br />Waterfalls halt their flow and turn to ice, while broken bridges mend themselves, inviting passage for all.<br />Once, I was fortunate enough to encounter a group of pilgrim priests,<br />Who foresaw future disasters in their dreams. They guided me to change my path,<br />Warning me to avoid ancient Luina carved from solid rock.<br />It had long fallen into ruin, turning into a realm of death and slaughter.<br />Being cautious by nature, I followed their advice,<br />While they turned away from me and summoned the collapsing cliffs, towards fate.}}
