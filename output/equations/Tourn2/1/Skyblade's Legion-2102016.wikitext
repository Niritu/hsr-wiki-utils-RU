==Story==
{{Description|Let me tell you about a group of mighty warriors, the strife between blades.<br />Amidst the war between the Mildanians and ourselves, warriors who believe in Nikador align themselves with different factions,<br />And the impartial War God grants power to the brave,<br />Even if they do not guard themselves.<br />The Mildanians' heavily armored infantry strides forward with great momentum, marching towards mobile fortresses.<br />Their battle cries resonate like rolling waves across the phalanx, and their spears converge in the sky, forming a downpour of crossing blades.<br />Their guards move like a river in battle, flexible yet unyielding,<br />With ever-changing formations that leave even Kremnos vanguards struggling to keep pace.<br />Kremnos, an unmatched city-state, stands victorious as the king's spear pierces the other's heart.<br />But I'll never forget the warriors who stood alongside me, sharing in the glory of our victories.}}
