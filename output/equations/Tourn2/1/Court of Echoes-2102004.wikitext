==Story==
{{Description|It's been ages since we last met, though for you, this is our first encounter.<br />We wander across the vast land, recording our journeys in conch shells.<br />And when moments allow, we also carve echoes for others.<br />The bygone eras linger in the dreams of Oronyx.<br />Each time I take a conch from someone, I embrace their past.<br />Though my eyes haven't witnessed the fall of ages,<br />The echoes from the conch, handed down by that old lady, resonate deeply within me.<br />I'm not truly myself. I'm just a bearer of stories.<br />When I swap my conch with the next companion, I transform into a new entity.<br />Everyone can be me, and I can become anyone.<br />When the next iteration of me crosses your path, I'm sure you'll be astounded once more.}}
