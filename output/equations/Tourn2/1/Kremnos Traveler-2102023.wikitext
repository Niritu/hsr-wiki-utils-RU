==Story==
{{Description|One winter, I met a lone warrior, lively as the flame undimmed by the falling snow.<br />That exhausted lady pulled me back from the brink of death. She was one of the rare Kremnoans among Flame-Chasers.<br />With her sharp spear, she came to claim the honor,<br />And the lives of gods for the Father of Victory.<br />She was a typical Kremnoan, who wiped away blood that froze upon her blade, closing the eyes of the dead.<br />"May the souls of warriors find rest in Nikador's domain."<br />She rejected my invitation disdainfully and set off on her journey to slay the gods alone.<br />Do you truly believe a mortal can kill a Titan, even when Janus' demigod has declared their prophecy?<br />"Yes. Even if I perish in trying, one day, a Kremnoan will sever the head of a god."}}
