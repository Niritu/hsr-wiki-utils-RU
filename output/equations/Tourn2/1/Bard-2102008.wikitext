==Story==
{{Description|One-eyed Helioticus, are you still collecting those stories?<br />Take a moment to rest your feet and share your own past.<br />I've heard that Mnestia's scales once kissed your throat,<br />Yet it was corroded by the seawater in the final expedition, taking with it your eye.<br />Was that a type of good fortune? From that doomed Flame-Chase, you managed to survive.<br />Yet, you continue to wander across the land, chronicling the golden heroes, the bloodthirsty villains,<br />And even sing of insignificant mortals.<br />You listen for their steps<br />Through the whispers of butterflies, inscribed tablets, and the tides of the River of Souls.<br />Are you endeavoring to immortalize them through your words? Or do you hope to<br />Have faded away with the times on that fateful day?}}
