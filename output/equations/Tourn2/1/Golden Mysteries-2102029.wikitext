==Story==
{{Description|I must accuse! Accuse those fiends who deserve nothing less than eternal torment!<br />The scoundrels who claimed to be heirs of Mnestia, used forbidden rites to insult gold dust that defiled pure love.<br />The stronger the wind, the farther it spread.<br />I cannot erase the grotesque scene from my mind. Those confused youths<br />Fell in love with whatever appeared before their eyes.<br />Some knelt, humbly begging an apple tree to love them forever.<br />Others took their family in arms, incestuous thoughts growing in their minds.<br />These poor soulless beings, unable to labor or think anymore,<br />Only knew to profess their desire to everyone in sight. How pathetic!<br />A city-state, once blessed by the Chrysalis of Gold, was destroyed in the very name of love.}}
