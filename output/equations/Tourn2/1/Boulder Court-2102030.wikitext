==Story==
{{Description|You want to know where I am going? It's my homeland, surrounded by mountains.<br />The cliffs there are adorned with awkwardly carved flowers, and the dromas rest in the valley, lulled to sleep by laughter of the inhabitants.<br />We were from every corner of Amphoreus.<br />In the deep ruins, we wailed in the cold rains until the Mountain Dwellers took them in.<br />The Mountain Dwellers lost everything, including their gods.<br />They stopped smelting. Their clumsy hands started to plow and sow. Their sturdy arms cradled new life.<br />Nurture was the last calling left to humans by the Pillar of Stone.<br />The earth has fallen. The Coreflame-carrying beasts have disappeared.<br />And I'll fold my hands in prayer to Georios. May life flourish again.}}
