==Story==
{{Description|Helioticus, I hear your hoarse voice.<br />It has been ages since you last visited your old friend, me, the aging Phies.<br />Old scars from pitiable wars means I can no longer see your face,<br />But please believe me, the statue in my workshop captures your very essence more vividly than you yourself.<br />The kids keep their distance from me, frightened by those mechanical statues.<br />With a touch of paint and some skillful craftsmanship, they walk<br />And talk and smile just like those fellows who died in the sea.<br />Have I outdone those mechanics and sculptors now?<br />If blessed by Georios, I even feel that<br />I could accomplish the incredible feat of recreating life and bringing them all back...<br />Oh no, I think I feel a gear on my elbow.}}
