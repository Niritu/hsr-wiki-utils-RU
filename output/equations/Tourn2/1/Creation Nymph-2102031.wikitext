==Story==
{{Description|You've surely met the servants of love, the minions of the Creators.<br />Undaunted by danger and obstacles, they were butterflies and beetles traversing across strife and the end times,<br />Searching for the shattered remains of the gods for Cerces.<br />They reclaimed wisdom from folklore and sacred texts and gathered romance from couples and love songs.<br />The weavers of love aimed to reweave the divine intellect.<br />They weaved the love hymns of two gods and all living things.<br />The words once whispered by fate to butterflies are now reproduced within the threads and fabrics.<br />From the first bloom to the last city,<br />Should you step into their tapestry, you will find a world upon the satin.<br />In my view, those weavers of the olden days,<br />Are the greatest bards of Amphoreus.}}
