==Story==
{{Description|Your music pales in comparison to that of my old acquaintance, the gorgeous Dekamos.<br />Instead of strumming the strings, the harpist said:<br />"You are not worthy of hearing her melody."<br />"Only a lover, or a mortal enemy, can make her sing."<br />He closed his eyes, bashful in a manner unlike a typical Mythemian.<br />That was the first time I witnessed a harpist caress his "companion" in the waters.<br />The harp bestowed by Phagousa, made of flowing water, wielded divine power through its currents.<br />Its music, morphed into a vortex, rent the soul of the living.<br />I saw enemies descend into madness. Sea monsters bit through their own necks.<br />That was the greatest water lyrist I'd ever seen.<br />The music, vibrating with the waves, drowned a pursuing force in the ensuing tidal wave.}}
