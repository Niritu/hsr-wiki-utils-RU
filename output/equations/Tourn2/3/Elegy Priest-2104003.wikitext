==Story==
{{Description|Would you believe it, passing friends?<br />Just now, I witnessed the demise of millennia.<br />Travelers singing dirges plucked a star from their clothes<br />And planted a fragment of time in the soil as if sowing a seed.<br />I saw the ruins of Styxia, kissed by the River of Souls.<br />I saw Loukas consumed in a sea of flames.<br />The fire devoured everything in its path.<br />These events, once real and long past, were recorded by the travelers<br />And brought back before our eyes.<br />I asked them why they came?<br />The travelers revealed that they were plucking broken memories.<br />This city has long been annihilated.<br />As for us, we are merely souls under Oronyx's Miracle,<br />The final elegy of farewell.}}
