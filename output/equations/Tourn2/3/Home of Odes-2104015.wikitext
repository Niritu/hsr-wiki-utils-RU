==Story==
{{Description|It's a pity that I cannot accompany you, my friend.<br />We are about to eradicate that detestable group,<br />A deranged cult that preys on children.<br />They give each of the children a poem<br />That glorifies a "past" entwined with inhuman torture.<br />The child named Corinchi was forced to strangle a venomous snake at the age of three,<br />While Dekamos played the harp until their pinky snapped.<br />To fulfill the delusions of the Mad One,<br />How many youths have been deprived of their lives,<br />Never becoming Corinchi, only to drown in despair?<br />And how many are on their way to becoming them,<br />Until they fall from the peak of Mount Tilkoya?<br />Even as we speak, the wicked rituals continue,<br />All to recreate the legends of heroes with the same tragic past.}}
