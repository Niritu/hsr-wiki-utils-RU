==Story==
{{Description|I am still searching for their traces. The traces of the subjects of gods, who, blessed by the Eye of Twilight,<br />Once dwelt high in the sky.<br />Mythical winged beasts wielding swords forged with wisdom surpassing that of mortals<br />And from thunder.<br />Warriors born of Aquila's blessings,<br />Who dedicated their all to the Titans in the divine war.<br />Their valor matched only by the Kremnoans blessed by Nikador.<br />But why have they vanished like the silent black tide?<br />Did the incarnation of the day thunder not once pierce the sky?<br />Without her heroic feats, who would dare raise the banner to slay gods?<br />Or were they, too, cursed by the Titans, just as we are,<br />Punished for daring to draw swords against the gods?}}
