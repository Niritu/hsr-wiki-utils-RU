==Story==
{{Description|Burn my remains to ashes and put them in a bottle.<br />Inscribe playful words upon it, then throw it into the sea.<br />Shed no tears at my funeral, for Phagousa would only laugh at your grief.<br />Don't blame my untimely demise, as I merely wished to get to my final resting place sooner.<br />I rode the waves while I lived,<br />And now, in death, I shall drift along with the ocean currents.<br />My only concern is how to secure an audience with Phagousa.<br />If I come empty-handed, they'll surely scorn me.<br />But I was born with nothing, so there's nothing I can take with me.<br />Luckily, I've crafted a brilliant joke, my masterpiece,<br />I'll share it with Phagousa as a gift upon our meeting.<br />If you see the waves roaring, it's a sign that they are pleased.}}
