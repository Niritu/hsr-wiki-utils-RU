==Story==
{{Description|Look! I've dug up a gear of the Book-Weaving Divine Machine.<br />My ancestors were fortunate enough to behold that magnificent machine.<br />Looming in the valley of the Pioli mountains,<br />It tirelessly copied knowledge for humanity, day in and day out.<br />Its towering bronze frame soared skyward,<br />Adorned with intricate gold threads.<br />Pages cascaded down like a waterfall,<br />Spreading the wisdom even to the remotest city-states.<br />If the divine machine willed it, the books it produced could cover the earth.<br />Alas,<br />This shared treasure of all city-states was ruined by greed.<br />Kings and lords all coveted it, even just a fragment.<br />This mere gear is a piece of its shattered limb, torn apart by humanity.}}
