==Story==
{{Description|You evil birds, the plague of the skies.<br />You steal Aquila's radiant glory and wreak havoc on all living beings,<br />Devouring wheat fields and invading city-states.<br />Unbreakable by swords and impervious to arrows,<br />Only the boiling golden blood of the Chrysos Heir can consume you.<br />Yet, as soon as new seeds are planted, you rise again with relentless ferocity.<br />Upon you, I cast the darkest curse.<br />May you suffer hunger, ending up devouring one another.<br />May your wings snap and crash you into the dirt.<br />May your entire clan fall, leaving no feather nor trace alive.<br />As for me, I vow to ascend as an eagle in the sky,<br />Crushing you under my golden claws.<br />No, it doesn't end with me &mdash; my descendants shall all become eagles,<br />crushingontinuing the eternal hunt, from one generation to the next.}}
