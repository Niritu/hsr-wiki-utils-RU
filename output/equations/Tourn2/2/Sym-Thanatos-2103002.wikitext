==Story==
{{Description|Let me tell you the story of cowards huddling together for warmth, whom I scorn.<br />In life, countless doors open, each concealing an unknown landscape.<br />But the last door is certain. It opens to fire and ashes.<br />It reeks of decay. Though you dare not to approach, a relentless force behind you pushes you forward.<br />You pretend to be calm but cannot suppress the fear inside.<br />Faced with this eternal conundrum, the weaklings gathered.<br />They paraded in mourning clothes, persuading others to join their ranks.<br />But what they joined was nothing more than a grand funeral.<br />How ridiculous it is, rushing hand-in-hand towards the door of death.<br />Yet, the hand of Thanatos gently swept over, regardless of whether there were a million or just one.}}
