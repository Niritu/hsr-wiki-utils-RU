Based on the total Shield Effect of all allies, deals Physical DMG to all enemies.
|story   = When distant worlds fade away amidst the howls of destruction, the people of Bavelli-3 would have never once fathomed that the ray storm heralding death and destruction would penetrate the magnetic field's protective measures, stripping their flesh from their bones. You lean against a window aboard the interstellar rescue ship, witnessing your homeland with your brethren rotting away, now a horrific hellhole. Even if you managed to flee in time, you'd have to sustain your health with genetic reconstruction medication for the rest of your life.<br /><br />The reaper is a madman, knocking on the gates of every civilization without warning or notice. You finally understand the meaning of the wall-building journey of that "foolish" god: To survive, one must prepare for a rainy day. Your world may be dead, but there are many more who still hold the right to live. You will build high walls for them, with their towering shadows interwoven into mountains that will blanket the sky, like the embracing arms of their mothers and fathers that will protect them from rain and snow, storm, and frost.

|story   = In a flourishing world of opulence, never before set foot upon by Memokeepers, you weave a brand-new visage &mdash; not too young, not too old, a face not even a mirror can capture, only in the eyes of people, as you elegantly stroll along the alleyways. You trade candy for a night of adventure from the songs of a shepherd boy and pluck a distant lover from the eyes of a sorrowful youngster. You retrieve a comrade's countenance for a wizened man, and he gifts you with the tragic war campaign of when the heavenly tower was toppled.<br /><br />Intelligent life &mdash; nothing more than mayflies in the folds of the universe. From faraway grasslands to warp jump stations that occupy half a city, their builders have experienced long stints of life. But these barely compare to the time it took for Redfeather Wolves to evolve. You know that the stories before you will eventually fade away, but in the paradise that transcends the physical, there are memories that remain immortal.

|story   = The spiraling, fathomless abyss hovers in the misted dream, deeper and darker than the dimmest corner of the world, where even the lightless background can also cast slices of shadows on it. You gaze at that vortex, your life infinitely extended, diced into shards that flow and fall, from the ground into the sky. You jump up, hoping to keep your doppelganger. But when you stretch out your hand to touch it, all you can feel is a cold wall.<br /><br />This is your home, but it may also not be, your memories full of holes gradually rotting away. You see your other self walk out, open the door, but fall right into darkness with one step. You try to rush over and catch him, but you just can't seem to find your vanished arms.<br /><br />You raise your head in bewilderment &mdash; the sun has sunk into the great sea, and like melted flakes of snow, you also start to melt. You are fading into yourself &mdash; perhaps you are the sun? You once again fall into the abyss.

|story   = When the three hundred and thirty-three nations in the planetary system dwindle to mere names, the destiny of annihilation has already visited, following the path laid out by the curses of the dead. The cessation of war fails to heal the wounds that have no bottom line. All residents had their DNA shredded and shattered, and even the president cowering in his bunker has not been spared.<br /><br />You pull with all the knowledge you've amassed in your lifetime, but the deformities and organ failure grip the other end of the rope tightly, dragging people into the afterworld. Until one day, a foreign envoy with branches sprouting out of his back arrives with a divine elixir. He halts the spread of the festering disease, preaching to us that only with THEIR divine power can salvation for the residents be achieved. The merciful Sanctus Medicus spreads THEIR healing wings, lifting the heavy burden of suffering from humanity's shoulders, and quenches all worldly desires with THEIR immortality elixir.<br /><br />The fleet from the Seaview Nebula sets sail, seeking the elixir from the hands of Yaoshi, aiming to quell the audacity of perpetual death and epidemic.

|story   = You are living in the worst times right now. Sin and evil are widespread throughout the stars, and justice does not prevail. They say violence is never the solution to your problems, but when the arm of righteousness is sorely absent, you will discover no hesitation in pulling the trigger. An eye for an eye, blood for blood &mdash; that is the fundamental law of nature of the world. You extract your gun chamber from the beast's maw, meticulously polishing it to maintain its pristine condition. You are on a path to vanquish evil right in its cradle as it desires to expand.<br /><br />Search and destroy is your bread and butter, and hunting is your life's dessert. The moguls terrorizing their local areas see you as a thorn in their sides. They live in fear at the mere glimpse of your figure when they awake from their worst nightmares. The rampant warmongers spew proclamations to brew you into a fine wine and scatter your liquid remains across space, but when they really do face off against you, they can only slink away in cowardice.<br /><br />You will become a sharpened sword that hangs over the center of the cosmos, a blade that thrusts right through the hubris of evil.

Whenever a character is attacked or loses HP, they will gain an additional hit of DMG the next time the Boundary Resonance is triggered, up to {{Color|h|20}} hits.
|story   = To this day, you can still remember that sheer joy, when the implosion bomb devoured the Blue Robin star system in one fell swoop, the heavy air of destruction suffocating that ridged space. As the most decorated general of the empire, the allure of those so-called riches and glory have long been unable to slake your desire &mdash; you seek despair and destruction! You will toy with those rebels in the palm of your hand, sprinkling false hope on them, and then, when you lure them into your trap, you will absolutely shatter that hope.<br /><br />Then THEIR gaze finally falls upon you. As you hear the wails of the weak, the brands of Destruction sear into their bodies, and you savor this moment &mdash; you destroy your own self, and you are reborn anew. The mission that the Supreme Destroyer has entrusted unto you, a brutality that cannot be fettered surging through your chest... Your multitudes will all be transformed into balls of anti-matter flames, wreaking havoc across the battlefield with abandon, incapable of distinguishing friend from foe.

And all allies' Basic ATK/Skill/Ultimate DMG are all considered as follow-up attack DMG, lasting for {{Color|h|1}} turn(s).
|story   = Farroke's fine wines are galactically renowned. Their complex brewing artisanship and exquisite flavors are only privy to the most luxurious of banquets, where only one bottle can be served, for their esteemed guests to savor with relish. What they will never know is how you conjured up a dynasty's providence into it, packaged it into utmost elegance, so that when they imbibe the secretions of the Bomu protozoa, they do so with an expression of uppity glee.<br /><br />The compatriots in the tavern all hug their bellies in jovial banter, while the attendant Bragi presents you with a half-full crystal glass &mdash; to score this joke with drink instead of words. The beverage is slightly bitter with a rosy fragrance, concocted from a fruit extracted from bitter hatred felt after falling from great heights. You satisfactorily sip on it, your mask concealing your expression, and listen to even more stories among the raucous clamor.<br /><br />Among the wanton flow of soda, the collapse of inorganic judges, and the frozen lands of splintered realms, the glass runs dry before you realize.

When any enemy unit gets defeated by a character that has {{Trait|Levitation}}, Boundary Equation regenerates {{Color|h|50}} Energy, with the Max Energy set at 200.
|story   = Circling over a world already extinct, the radiating deathly rays devoured all fleshly things that once breathed, including your dying offspring. They gather into a river, wriggling across a barren wasteland. But worry not &mdash; drink off their juices, scatter your spores, and more offspring armed with piercing shrieks will be born. Their tender shells have not yet been tempered by fire, and only by being the last standing, shedding layers of their shackles, can they witness the return of the Imperator Insectorum.<br /><br />You have not heard THEIR voice for too long, but the hold of time is far too weak to a Swarm King. Even if you traveled to the ends of the cosmos, you would not be too perplexed by THEIR silence. The tides of propagation do not cease. The insects are chosen between die and being killed. They will evolve, break out of their molted shells and be reborn, just like THEM.

Additionally, links the enemy with the highest Max HP with other enemies, inflicting {{Trait|Central Link}} on all enemies and regenerating Energy equal to {{Color|h|50%}} of Max Energy to all allies.
|story   = The boundless expanse of the star-studded sky casts its sublime shadow that enshrouds myriad worlds. Listen carefully, and you can touch its pulse, the murmurs of stellar helium flashes, the silence of the black hole's accretion, spots of light both bright and dark flowing between it, proteins, organisms, and civilizations crawling onto the riverbank, opening their curious eyes.<br /><br />You measure its history, from its uncooled past to its probable future of heat death, assessing the dynamics of civilization and the alternation of celestial bodies. The majestic expedition ships are migrating species. Void song whales and mite fungi will decompose the residue of the cosmos &mdash; the might of the gods is but a torrid current in the sea of life.<br /><br />The stars are a magnified ecosystem, composed of matter and energy, where a stretch of lake and stars clustered across the sky are fundamentally no different. You will deconstruct and restore the secrets of the universe, indulging yourself in the stunning vista measured in light years.

|effect  = Comet Nucleus appears in the Action Order: Each time it takes a turn, absorbs all allies' Shields, reducing their values to 1, and turning the absorbed values into its own Shield. Then, it deals Physical DMG equal to {{Color|h|2,500%}} of its Shield value plus {{Color|h|1,000%}} {{Trait|base DMG}} to all enemies, with a {{Color|h|75%}} base chance to Freeze enemies for {{Color|h|1}} turn(s). When characters take damage, Comet Nucleus's Shield will be consumed first. When {{Trait|Quake}} DMG is triggered, {{Color|h|70%}} of Comet Nucleus's Shield will be considered as the character's Shield.
|story   = You lean against the window of the ship, with a desolate world in despair beneath you. The fires of war have utterly ravaged its lands &mdash; the penetrative destruction of the Antimatter Bomb even boring a gaping maw over the plains itself, crushing the undercity in its wake. The people's heads lifted, their gazes trained on you. Those are eyes you are unflinchingly familiar with &mdash; devoid of hope and sadness, with hollowed sockets that have eventually lost even the will to feel anger.<br /><br />But you do not despair. Even if the eternal night annihilated a hundred Amber Eras of the Kardian Republic, you would sift through the earth for silvery vestiges of the past, all just to dig up its tapestries of history. Even more so for present-day Halover &mdash; as long as its people survived, a thousand, nay, ten thousand decimations could not prevent the sprouting of civilization from blossoming once more. You will walk towards those numbed faces, rebuild their walls for them, and restore civilization one tile at a time, one brick at a time.

|effect  = When enemy targets enter battle, there is a {{Color|h|100%}} base chance for them to be inflicted with {{Trait|Dissociation}} that lasts for {{Color|h|1}} turn(s). Enemies in {{Trait|Dissociation}} will resist all DMG, and all CRIT DMG and Break DMG taken are tallied. When the effect is dispelled, additionally deals a set amount of CRIT DMG equal to {{Color|h|150%}} of the tallied value to all enemies. When the tallied value reaches {{Color|h|50%}} of the target's Max HP, {{Trait|Dissociation}} will immediately be dispelled.
|story   = For the royals and nobles of court, as well as the luminaries with their masteries, their deeds are known throughout the universe, to all who hear their tales. But to you, this is the most banal story of them all. How would youngsters aboard subspace warp jump ships even imagine that in the gloomy underground, there are mine-digging Tellarians who have never even linked up with the Interastral Peace Network before? Those ostentatious merchants sipping on fine wine at Pier Point, they could never hear the lamentations of the Hyper-distant Delivery porters.<br /><br />Their voices are too meek, like the snow in early winter, never fully formed before they melt. You will howl in the stead of those muted throats, to let the universe hear the voices of the dust. You will infiltrate the pitch-black nocturne, to tell the people not to go quietly in the night. You are recording the joys in the dirt treated with spite by others, recording the tragedies and evils on the battlefields of dictators and butchers.<br /><br />If all of humanity has lost its voice, then you will become their final tongue.

The state increases DMG taken by {{Color|h|60%}}, lasting for {{Color|h|2}} turn(s).
|story   = Nothing is permanent, not even permanence itself. People's bodies decay, stories fade away, and the third death named "forgotten" will always lie in wait. You recall the great tree that stood in front of your gate as a child. Its branches broke, its sap flowed like weeping pus, then it made a full recovery. That repulsive scar will remain with it for eternity, until the soil becomes poison and the buildings collapse to the ground one after one.<br /><br />You want to leave a scar on the universe too, to make it suffer and remember your name. The pulverized stars burst into brilliant light and the destructive scene is bored into the eyes of all living beings, ensuring that the fear of this day is passed down to every generation for eternity. The call of death advances toward the end of the world. Endless millennia later, when even the amber that constructs the walls crumbles, there will still be those on distant shores who can see the delayed death rays.<br /><br />The hands of time have stopped, and your moment is no more. Only the scars of havoc still carry its stories of the past, told between nightmares in song.

At the start of an enemy's turn, they take Lightning DoT equal to {{Color|h|135%}} of {{Trait|base DMG}} and cause adjacent targets to take Lightning DoT equal to {{Color|h|20%}} of the original DMG multiplier. At {{Color|h|2}} or more stacks: At the start of the turn, regenerates {{Color|h|20%}} of {{Trait|Brain in a Vat}} for a random character. At {{Color|h|3}} or more stacks: At the start of the turn, regenerates {{Color|h|10%}} of {{Trait|Brain in a Vat}} for all allies.
|story   = The mercilessness of the universe is in the annihilation of the soul. When people reach the end, they walk towards that void &mdash; there is no future, no new life. They bring nothing with them, as if they've come to this world from the future. This is why death is oh-so horrifying. But even so, people can still leave something behind, a symbol of the fight against nihility, and as proof that certain names once existed.<br /><br />You have answered riddles that stumped the world, etching your name using formulae and history. You have treated plagues that ravaged stars, where white crystalline statues erected in your honor will far outlive you. Time is too short, thus your mind and hands never stop for a moment, proposing axioms and creating machines. The people worship your relentless diligence, but never sense your fear.<br /><br />Faster, even faster, creating even more, leaving behind even more, until you'll never be forgotten.

Every stack of {{Trait|Grit}} held by the team will additionally increase the DMG by {{Color|h|1.5%}}.
|story   = The mechabeast's sharp fangs tear through the battlefield, its insatiable bloodlust and malevolence unmistakable, as it masticates the prey's bridge and devours the opponent's retaliation, shoving it down its throat. Roots made for ingestion peel away the weak skin, tracing its onslaught, as you valiantly leap into the heart of the enemy's ship. The blood thrumming in your veins drives you, and even the armor on your back seems to echo with vigor.<br /><br />Sharp fangs slice through throats, claws maul through armor, and the feeble primate trembles under the destruction of the Lupitoxin. You extinguish his life as easily as crushing an ant, and this bores you a little. Ignoring the relentless itch that is penetrating your skin, you hold a weapon that only a slave will use, inching closer to your scattered prey, your body swelling.<br /><br />The cycle of nature sees the weak surrender all to the wolves. Sipping on the blood of sheep, gnawing on bones and flesh, and draping on howling furs, the blades of war shall paint the lands in crimson red.

|story   = The universe is a web and life is its pattern. Every time life is destroyed, the loom's shuttle shall trace along the trail of tears to seal the wounds that have not yet spread.<br /><br />You place yourself inside the silver "needle" and traverse the wastelands of Ladiklan, jabbing into the bodies of refugees of war, strangling pathological cells, and extracting fatal ailments. You place yourself into the red "thread" and float through the pollution zone of the Kuvida Nebula, entangling the genes of the refugees, connecting the survival of a race, and repairing their genetic rifts.<br /><br />There is no place that is free from war and disaster, and the shuttle never stops. As you rush towards any place from which you hear the sounds of crying, you stitch the web of life and use it to shelter humanity from disease and hardships. One day, it will be torn apart, but you will repair it again and again until there are no more laments in the universe.

|story   = From the moment you open your eyes in the incubator, the armor that has appeared countless times in the queen's dream is once again displayed before you. You reach out with your hands, and they wobble slightly from your unfamiliarity of using a body for the first time. Your fingers caress the cold steel of the armor's surface. As if harking your anticipation, a resplendent fire spins around it and slowly spreads out, attaching itself to you, and becoming a part of you forever.<br /><br />You eliminate all your enemies, disintegrate them into ashes, and ignite your thruster. The behaviors etched into your DNA then start to be executed. You hurtle headfirst into the Swarm, swiftly locking on to the weakest chink in their armor, and a fiery curtain shrouds the skyline, illuminating the horizon of the fallen Gresta. The roar of slaughter echoes out non-stop in your consciousness, as you rip out the monster's heart, as if you've already practiced this move a thousand times over, like a larva that knows to feast from the day it is hatched.

The remnant survivors extract their own memories, importing them all into a scalding hot component. And thus you open your eyes, your mind echoing with your sole duty.<br /><br />You ignite the fusion furnace, carrying the remaining genomes with you and hurtling away from the mother star &mdash; she is too far gone from the taint of desire, never able to give life to her terra again. The children are hatched within you. Within the incubator, and as the guardian of a new generation, you have the right to protect them from any harm, till the day the voyage ends.<br /><br />The journey is long, and there are too many threats that the children will face: Meteors on a course of collision, aliens of sinister intent, and many more.

When a single variable drops below a certain threshold, the destruction brought about by the butterfly effect will unfold in ways that people could never have imagined. The answer to every question is found inside the Formula of Destruction.<br /><br />People despise the study of Destruction, and even the most deranged arms dealer would be ashamed to publicly recognize the topic of murder. Yet you say that Destruction is the most perfect form of art &mdash; that even the most perfect model of the universe would be fated to be obliterated by THEIR fiery rage. As you design rigorous experiments, you include one variable after another, working from the destruction of ant colonies to the decay of stars. Though the samples' variety grows ever more abundant, the conclusion always remains the same.<br /><br />If there were a single formula that is able to properly describe every single thing in the universe, you believe that could only be Destruction.

They may be looking for what cannot be obtained, or lost in fatigue, and seek a quick fix. Just include them in the prescription, and a life of sinking lows may be spared.

The crestfallen who wish to rise again, the dejected who yearn for companionship, that royal who longs for eternal reign, and that noble who desires to keep his people blinded to his follies, they all knock on the gate of your store, bringing with them jokes, tricks, and gags big and small, for ideas great and tiny.<br /><br />Is the devil's tongue the antidote, or poisoned wine? It is up to the person to determine.

You direct the bubbles under the curtain into the Battle Fortress of Sonagnat.

Memory is an art of falsehoods, but any permutation and combination can turn reality entirely on its own head.

|story   = Homicides are common in Heldorin. The smugglers hiding in the border star systems carry unforgivable sins of murder, yet they are trying to turn this place into a second criminal haven, to which the authorities turn a blind eye. You hack into their goggles, and your assisting machine shifts sideways and shields you from incoming attacks upon receiving commands. The anesthetic gas permeating the room soon deprives the criminals of their ability to resist, allowing you to accomplish the mundane everyday task.<br /><br />You infiltrate into viscous bioships, incapacitating the glands that are preparing to launch a strike. Wearing an exoskeleton, you charge into illegal memoria trading dens, engaging in close combat with Harbeck mercenaries. These chaotic scenarios of different scales never seem to end.<br /><br />Still, you press on for the peace of Heldorin.

As a result, clusters of fungi engulf the stars, and the spreading red tide leaves the ocean suffocating.<br /><br />You move between different nodes, following their traces, and racking your brain for ways to eliminate the creatures that do not belong here. The parasitic wild bees infest the ants, and the poisonous rain burns the surface of the flowers &mdash; different situations call for different actions.

One hour ago, a routine inspection of the capsule pipeline led to a half-an-hour delay which caused him to grow extremely anxious and rushed to the venue himself, regardless of manners and presentation. Two minutes ago, his opponent's unyielding demeanor caused him to grow extremely unsettled and he ventured outside to take some fresh air, as he always does in these situations.

If an ossified tree does not decay, the new shoots under the shade can hardly grow.<br /><br />If you extinguish the stars, they will bury the hatchet, or they won't be able to survive in the cold and silence of the eternal night.
