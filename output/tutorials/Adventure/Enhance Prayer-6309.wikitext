|text1     = Interacting with Oronyx's Shrine summons the Realm of the Ages. Within this realm, the {{Color|h|nobold=1|color of the energy ripples on memory-laden objects changes}}, indicating that the Trailblazer's rewinding ability is now unrestricted.

|text2     = Within the realm, a {{Color|h|nobold=1|single ({{tt|tap|on mobile}}/{{tt|press|on controller}}/{{tt|click|on keyboard}})}} is sufficient to continuously complete the entire rewinding process, with {{Color|h|nobold=1|no three-second time limit}}. Additionally, pressing the rewind button again during rewinding on the same target temporarily interrupts the process.

|text3     = You can evaluate whether the realm has been activated by looking out for {{Color|h|nobold=1|the presence of a floating ball of light}} near the Trailblazer. The realm will dissipate when you are a certain distance away from the shrine, and the boost for your Rewind powers will also disappear.
