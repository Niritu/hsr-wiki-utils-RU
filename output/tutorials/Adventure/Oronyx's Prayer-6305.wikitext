|text1     = In Amphoreus, memory-laden objects can be found everywhere. When the Trailblazer approaches, they reveal an energy ripple over them. At this point, by {{Color|h|nobold=1|holding down the button, you can use "Oronyx's Prayer"}} to rewind them to their previous state from a certain time ago.

|text2     = The power of Oronyx's Prayer has limitations. Under normal conditions, it can only {{Color|h|nobold=1|be sustained for three seconds}}. If used beyond three seconds without the object rewinding to the critical time point, it will return to its state prior to activating the ability.
