|text1     = The Spirithief is a (self-proclaimed) well-known master thief across Amphoreus. {{Color|h|nobold=1|They enjoy stealing treasures others are just about to obtain and then vanishing into the void with their stolen goods}}. They tend to leave a Coin of Whimsy in mockery in the aftermath.

|text2     = The only thing that can punish them is Oronyx's power. {{Color|h|nobold=1|When near a Coin of Whimsy, use the rewinding powers provided by Oronyx's Prayer upon the fissures the thief escapes through}} to get the Spirithief to come back.

|text4     = While the Spirithief is in the special zone, you need to {{Color|h|nobold=1|release}} the button to end the praying, and then {{Color|h|nobold=1|({{tt|tap|on mobile}}/{{tt|press|on controller}}/{{tt|press the button|on keyboard}}) and hold}} when they are unprepared to bring the Spirithief to justice.
