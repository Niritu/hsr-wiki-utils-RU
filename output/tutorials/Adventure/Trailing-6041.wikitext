|text1     = When Trailing Mode is active, the {{Color|h|nobold=1|Gameplay Prompter}} will appear on top of the screen.

|text2     = Please {{Color|h|nobold=1|keep the target you're trailing within your line of sight}}. After your target has left your screen for a set amount of time, you will have {{Color|h|nobold=1|lost the target}}, and the mission {{Color|h|nobold=1|will be considered failed when the Prompter's countdown reaches zero}}. Please find your trailing target before the Prompter's countdown reaches zero.

|text3     = Performing actions that make it easy for the target to discover you, such as {{Color|h|nobold=1|running or sprinting}}, will increase the {{Color|h|nobold=1|value of the Alert Gauge}} in the Prompter. The louder your actions are, the faster the Alert Gauge value will increase. {{Color|h|nobold=1|When the Alert Gauge is full, the mission will be considered as failed}}.

|text4     = When Trailing Mode is active, a series of cover spots that you can shelter behind will be marked within the scene. Interact with a cover to enter {{Color|h|nobold=1|Stealth Mode}}. While in Stealth Mode, it becomes harder for the target you are trailing to discover you. However, be cautious not to hide in a spot that is directly in the target's line of sight.

|text5     = Please use a cover to enter Stealth Mode when you are about to be discovered by the target. Alternatively, put distance between you and your target without creating noise. {{Color|h|nobold=1|The Alert Gauge value will decrease once you maneuver out of the target's line of sight}}.
