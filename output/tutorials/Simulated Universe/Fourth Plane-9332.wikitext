|text1     = When you pass the Third Plane, you can choose to consume a certain number of extra Cycles to enter the {{Color|h|nobold=1|Fourth Plane}}. You cannot enter there if you do not have enough extra Cycles. Enemies in the Fourth Plane are even stronger, so Trailblazers who like a challenge can dive right in.
