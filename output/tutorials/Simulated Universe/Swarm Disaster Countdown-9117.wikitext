|text1     = The countdown is reduced by 1 with every movement. When the counter becomes negative, all enemy targets will enter {{Color|h|nobold=1|Planar Disarray}} mode and receive stat enhancements. While in {{Color|h|nobold=1|Planar Disarray}} mode, every movement on the map will increase the Disruption Level. The higher the Disruption Level, the stronger enemy buffs become.
