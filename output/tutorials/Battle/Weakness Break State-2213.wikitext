|text1     = When an enemy target's {{Color|h|nobold=1|Toughness}} is depleted to zero, they will enter a {{Color|h|nobold=1|Weakness Break State}}, during which the DMG they receive is increased. At the {{Color|h|nobold=1|beginning of the enemy target's turn}}, their Toughness will be restored, and the Weakness Break State will be removed.
