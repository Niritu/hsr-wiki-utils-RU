|text1     = When you attack an enemy using the same attack Type as their {{Color|h|nobold=1|Weakness}} and deplete their {{Color|h|nobold=1|Toughness}} to zero, it will trigger the {{Color|h|nobold=1|corresponding attack Type's Weakness Break effect}} and {{Color|h|nobold=1|delay their action}}. Simultaneously, this will also cause them to enter a state of {{Color|h|nobold=1|Weakness Break}}.
