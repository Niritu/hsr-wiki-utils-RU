|text1     = Using {{Color|h|nobold=1|Ice}} attacks to trigger Weakness Break will immediately deal {{Color|h|nobold=1|Ice Break DMG}} and apply the {{Color|h|nobold=1|Freeze}} effect. Freeze will cause enemies to be unable to take action and take Additional Ice DMG {{Color|h|nobold=1|at the start of their turn}}. After {{Color|h|nobold=1|Freeze}} is dispelled, Weakness Break will continue until the start of their next action.
