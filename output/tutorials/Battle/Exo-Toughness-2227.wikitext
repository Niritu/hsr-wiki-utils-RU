|text1     = Enemies with Exo-Toughness will trigger Weakness Break when their initial Toughness is reduced to 0. Then, their temporary Toughness can continue to be reduced. When temporary Toughness is reduced to 0, the enemy will receive Weakness Break DMG again. The effect will be removed after this occurs.
