|description = The flourishing Empire of Glamoth turned into dust. There was no evidence of its former glory. Only the debris of stardust, mechas, warships, and the corpses of the Swarm were left drifting in the vacuum to form a river of residua &mdash; preserving the original battle scene of the bloody warfronts and serving as a monument to its downfall.
