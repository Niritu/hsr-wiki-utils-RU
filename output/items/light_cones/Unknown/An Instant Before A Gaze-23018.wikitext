|description = He once heard a ballad, singing in praise of that sliver of light:<br />Rose blooms, to answer THEIR smile.<br />Dawn shines, to illuminate THEIR visage.<br />Melody plays, to banish THEIR fatigue.

{{Description|But, light, once gone, never returns. Yet, he still gallops to the far beyond.<br />All that is needed is to wait for, to believe in, and to preach about everything that is of the Beauty in this cosmos.<br />Even if everything is but a fleeting instant before a gaze, he has already found the answer he sought.}}
