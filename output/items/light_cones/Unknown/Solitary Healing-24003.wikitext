|description = Things molded by the hands of secrecy are shapeless and incorporeal.<br />In the totality of emptiness, there yet exists a sudden dreaming.<br />Those that court destruction will reap ruinous fruit, while those that clamor to live will survive.<br />That which is extinguished may yet spark, and that which has dried may yet be filled anew.<br />In compassion for the salvation of chaos, the elixir nurtures the shadows.<br />With back faced to the darkness between the stars, the encapsulation of this vessel can only be done in vain.
