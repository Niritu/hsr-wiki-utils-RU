|description = When the doctor found the wounded girl, she was clinging to a machine that had stopped working, with all sorts of parts filling her pocket.<br />She took the girl back to her clinic and treated the wounds.<br />Drops of sweat slowly rolled down the girl's cheek, but she remained silent and her hands didn't stop fiddling the machine.<br />To the doctor, the way the girl was attached to the machine was very much like how she was attached to her patients who needed help.<br />So the doctor did not try to comfort the girl nor did she nag her about being more careful; but rather, she sat down with her to give her a moment of peace.
