|description = The girl hides behind the door and dares not move one step closer. <br />Perhaps due to the fact that tonight's objective is already within her reach, her heart is actually beating faster.<br />"I'm not scared, not scared, not scared..."<br />In darkness, silence lets out a piercing scream.<br /><br />The girl is shivering and grasps the "weapon" in her hands tight, but still does not dare to approach the "target."<br />"There is nothing to be s&mdash;s&mdash;scared of!"
