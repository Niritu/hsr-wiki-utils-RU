|description = In reality, most prey don't realize when danger is encroaching.<br />This one's no exception.<br />The sniper's scope slowly centers on a man throwing banknotes stack after stack, who seems completely oblivious to his impending demise.<br />''"So that's what greed looks like. That amount is equal to several of my contracts already... No wonder someone wants him dead."''

{{Description|As if these thoughts were broadcasted out loud, the man in the scope turns his head, looking straight into the eyes of the sniper. <br />''"I've been waiting for you. Would this much be enough for you to hear me out?"''}}
