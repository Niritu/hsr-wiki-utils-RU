|description = The universe was like a badland filled with rubbish.<br />There were the occasional treasure that lies undiscovered.<br />They looked through the cracks of the past, choosing seeds of memory.<br />...If a new life was to be born, its seed has to be dead.<br />Precious stones of pink, blue, and white were brought forth,<br />twinkling gently in their seed plot,<br />even though the universe held onto its enigmatic silence.
