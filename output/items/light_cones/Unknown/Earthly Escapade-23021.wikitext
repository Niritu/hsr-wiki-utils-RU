|description = Just as fireworks can flicker, she too can shift between ten different colors in a minute.<br /><br />When the light show nears its end, she sits high above, regarding the bustling masses beneath her feet with boredom.<br />Thoughts flow and vanish, and slyness circulates across myriad eyes like a dancing kaleidoscope.<br />''"I've made my decision. This is how we're going to have fun today!"''
