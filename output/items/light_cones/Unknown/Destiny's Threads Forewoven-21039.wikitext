|description = Destiny always tows the masses onward without reason, and she lurks within the darkness, waiting to inscribe the most crucial of instants.<br /><br />Sorting, matching, shuffling, drawing... She simulates fate's hand in how it manipulates all variables for the masses, seeking the trajectory of truth beneath the visage of a disorderly exterior.
