|description = A record that can be played on the Express' phonograph. It might be a chance acquisition or a gift from someone else. All sorts of memories surge up when the music plays &mdash; the smiles, encounters, touches, and the excitement of battle. Maybe that is why people still collect records even as society rapidly advances.<br />The current record contains the track "Trampled Snake."
