|effect      = A record that can be played on the Express' phonograph. It might be a chance acquisition or a gift from someone else. All sorts of memories surge up when the music plays &mdash; the smiles, encounters, touches, and the excitement of battle. Maybe that is why people still collect records even as society rapidly advances.<br />The current record contains the track "fReeStyLE."
|description = <br />''Life is like a play, and everyone lives by their ability to perform. Even the most honest person will have days when they need to improv.''
