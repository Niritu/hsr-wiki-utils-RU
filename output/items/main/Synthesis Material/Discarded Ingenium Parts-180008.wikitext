{{Description|To a bystander, it's just trash. To a craftsman, it's leftover materials. To a recycler, it's credits. Only skilled artisans who truly understand the art of ingenia can see valuable treasures in what others deem wasteful.<br /><br />''"It is said that in the Great Trial of the Furnace, to challenge Mr. Yingxing, they gave him a pile of defective products and waste. But after a day and night, he crafted a lifelike mechanical lion that moved as if it was alive."''}}
