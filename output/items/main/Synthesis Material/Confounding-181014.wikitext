{{Description|I've never been outstanding since I was a kid. I barely met the requirements to get into college, and I barely earned enough credits to obtain my degree. Now, I'm sitting at my desk, contemplating how to explain my understanding of "confusion" to you, but am I really worthy of showering you with my superficial understanding? And do you really need to listen to all this broken gibberish of mine? I don't know the answer.<br /><br />''"Anyway, I hope you enjoy yourself."''}}
