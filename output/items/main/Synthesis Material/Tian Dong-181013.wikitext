|description = While plants of the Tian Dong genus typically grow on land, Tian Dong plants of Scalegorge Waterscape stand out by extensively inhabiting the coastal areas of the Lunarescent Depths. Although artificial cultivation techniques for Tian Dong have become quite prevalent, there are still many who believe in the superstition that "wild plants have stronger medicinal properties," causing significant trouble for the Pearlkeepers.
