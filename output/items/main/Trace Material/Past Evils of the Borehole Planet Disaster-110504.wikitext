{{Description|As a descendant bred personally by the Imperator Insectorum, its only desire is to expand the numbers of its kind. It uses giant scythes to harvest planets for its nest, tirelessly nurturing countless offspring, and devastating innumerable lives until the moment of its death.<br /><br />''"On the broken planet, giant locusts blotted out the sky, and swarms of insects poured out of the planet's crust. The stag beetle raised this new nest and presented it as a gift to its Imperator Insectorum... May this horror only exist in historical records, never to appear again."''}}
