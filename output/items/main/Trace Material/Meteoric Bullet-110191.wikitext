{{Description|The Armed Archaeologists discovered these iron pellets among various types of monster fossils and bones. Radioactive dating confirmed that they were fired in an era when humanity did not yet exist, and the creatures they shot were the last remnants of a certain monster species.<br /><br />''"Death by old age is no different from death by bullet. The way of the hunter won't lead to a sacred nor sinful end."''}}
