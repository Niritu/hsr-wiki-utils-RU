{{Description|One day and night after drinking the nectar of the divine tree, the ridiculous spherical fruit bloats into a "Devil" wearing fiber armor and wielding a wooden spear and a shield made of leaves. All around its footsteps, living creatures in the forest offer their genes as tributes to the Devil for it to taste, learn, and metamorphose. After that, the Devil will move on to challenge the sea and the sky of Vonwacq.<br /><br />''"Through this method, the ancient sages imprisoned the most terrifying thing within a most ridiculous game."''}}
