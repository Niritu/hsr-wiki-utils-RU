{{Description|The seeds take root and sprout. Branches and buds weave together, transmitting signals like a living network of synapses. Over the passage of years, some wither and fade, while others flourish, growing strong enough to bear life and form the vessel of a soul. <br /><br />''"We did not abandon the flesh. We merely transformed it into something... more enduring."''}}
