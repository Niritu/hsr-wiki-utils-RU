{{Description|It may be a large shield, but it feels as light as a feather. Even after taking on a full charge, no marks can be seen on the face of the shield.<br />Ancient legends tell of a war where high-spirited warriors wielded deathray-beaming spears and shields forged of Frost Steel, defended a nation destined to falter in the face of war.<br />This shield is a witness to that war.<br /><br />"''Powerful voices chant: 'The enemies are at our gates!&ast;''"}}
