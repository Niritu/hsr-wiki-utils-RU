{{Description|THEY alone played the supreme rhythm until it was downed in THEIR multiple choruses.<br />Yet, THEIR listeners refused to fall silent. As the foolish dreamer seized the string of the shared wish, the false player repeated the music forgotten by the world.<br /><br />''"Stars trace your fingers and command all living's law and authority... Sweet dreams nowadays have manifested, and the gazillions of old laws have all faded away."''}}
