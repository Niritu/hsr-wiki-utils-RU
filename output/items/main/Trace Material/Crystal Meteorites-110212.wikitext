{{Description|People only become aware of the fact that Qlipoth has swung THEIR hammer again from the two phenomena invariably detected afterward: An enormous burst of intense gravitational waves, and "starquakes." Like a gift from the Preservation, the crystal meteorites dash across the dark sky and announce the beginning of a new Era.<br /><br />''"The Genius Society is audacious enough to declare the Amber Lord as the slowest Aeon in the Cosmos, but none of these people have ever successfully observed the entire process of Qlipoth swinging the celestial hammer."''}}
