|description = Intricate parts dotted around the Disposal Site. Hardly anyone would notice these dated-looking dull little things. Iron and nickel are gifts from the shooting star, but ultra nickel is something entirely different... Produced with mysterious methods, this superalloy, though outdated in the eyes of Herta, is patented and has no competition in the entire universe.
