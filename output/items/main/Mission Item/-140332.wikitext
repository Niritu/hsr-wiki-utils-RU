<br />It is said that, in his mansion that day, General Teng Xiao was in deep thought, devising strategies and conducting simulations to break the encirclement of the borisin forces. Suddenly, a strange wind blew through the hall, causing the curtains to flutter.<br />General Teng Xiao stood up with his hands behind his back and spoke to the empty room, "It is impolite to be an uninvited guest, and even more so to hide in the shadows. Show yourself quickly!"<br />Laughter echoed through the empty hall, and suddenly, a formless green flame appeared, resembling a ghostly eye, fixating its eerie gaze on the general.<br />"I've heard of the exceptional abilities of the Reignbow's Arbiter-Generals, and seeing you today confirms those rumors."<br />"I entered these halls without prior notice, and for that, I apologize. However, my purpose here is to assist you in breaking the encirclement."<br />"The borisin's forces are closing in with the intention of annihilating the Luofu. Your troops are few, and resisting the enemy is as difficult as reaching the heavens."<br />Although the green flame had no mouth, it seemed to converse like a person. It hovered through the air, illuminating the dark corners of the hall. The guards in the hall stood expressionlessly, as if trapped in a dream.<br />"Facing life and death in battle, mortals tremble in fear. But if you allow us, the heliobi, to possess you, you'll have no fear of the enemy. Defeating them will be as easy as turning your hand."<br />"Your help freely offered must come with an exchange. I've heard that the Reignbow once exchanged their mortal body for aid from the Flint Emperor. I assume you have similar intentions?"<br />"I, Ignamar, seek nothing more than your body and emotions, General of the Reignbow." The jade flame burned brighter, growing to a size hundredfold bigger than before. "I have been dormant for a millennium, and there's no better corporeal offering for us than this!"<br />The general remained unfazed, signaling Ignamar to continue.<br />"At midnight tonight, I shall await your answer in Fyxestroll Garden. At the garden entrance, there will be several porcelain vases, some cerulean and some vermilion. If you refuse my offer, leave the {{Color|heliobus|nobold=1|cerulean vases}} pristine and {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|unharmed}}. At the same time, with the {{Color|fire|nobold=1|vermilion vases}}, you should {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|break them all}} if you accept my offer and wish for bloody battle."<br />"That is how I will be able to decipher your reply, general. After tonight, if you wish to meet me again, knock with the left door knocker three times, followed by the right knocker three times. No more, no less."<br />The general sighed, "A mere malevolent spirit dares to steal one's soul and mimic human behavior. Away, and I will respond in time."<br />...
