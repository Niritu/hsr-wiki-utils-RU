|description = The Xenohydro was confined within a Mystic Case in the shape of a trapezohedron, with one of the planes made from the Absolutely Objective Lens. It is observed that the Xenohydro has icy blue skin that has silver spots dotted around. If you look through other planes to observe the Xenohydro, you'll find that it looks rather different. In fact, the image of the Xenohydro will vary from person to person.
