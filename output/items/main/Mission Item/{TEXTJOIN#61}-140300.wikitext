|description = In Mr. Xiyan's story, this is the weapon you and {TEXTJOIN#59} managed to forge. You can tell at a glance that this {TEXTJOIN#61}, glowing with iridescent and otherworldly light, is no ordinary item.<br />In actuality, it is fitted with some LEDs in there. They light up if you press the switch. (Hold down the switch and the weapon will play a sound that says "Villain! Prepare to die!".)
