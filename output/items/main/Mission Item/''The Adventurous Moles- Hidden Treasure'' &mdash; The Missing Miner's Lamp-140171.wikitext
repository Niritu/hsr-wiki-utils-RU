Carbine and Pava were eavesdropping on the group's private chat when they were lifted up by a pair of gigantic hands, and Carbine was overcome with fear as his feet dangled in the air. Pava, on the other hand, shifted his weight, kicked the miner in the stomach, and jumped away. Only then did they notice the gigantic, towering miner.

"What on earth are you little brats doing here?" Pava's kick angered the tough and muscular miner, who huffed out: "It's dangerous out here. You should be at home, not here."

"Hey, you two kids over there. Remember how I told you not to fall out of line?" Becky donned her safety helmet, work gear, and gloves, and transformed into a little miner. "Can you let me handle these two kids, big guy? I'll get them out of here."

The two little moles understood Becky's words immediately. "We are lost, please take us back, sis."

The burly man was a little hesitant, having never seen such a short miner before, but he didn't think too much about it. "Keep an eye on your team. The mines are dangerous." The burly man turned and marched away, carrying a pickaxe heavier than Pava.

"I'm always the dependable one. What were you two eavesdropping on?" Becky inquired confidently, pushing up her safety helmet.

Pava was about to point to the group's location when he realized no one was there anymore.

{{Color|h|nobold=1|"I recall them saying, 'Let everything return to its rightful place. Let the stars return to the sky.'"}} "So that's what it is!" Carbine said after a brief moment of thinking and a glance at the wire mesh fence on the other side.

Carbine appears to have discovered the secret.

''&mdash; Dear readers, do you know what he should do?''
