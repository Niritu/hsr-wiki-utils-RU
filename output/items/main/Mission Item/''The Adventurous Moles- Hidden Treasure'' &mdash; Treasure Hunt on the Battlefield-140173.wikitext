"Don't let them get away!" The gathered crowd shouted incessantly from behind The Moles as these greedy criminals pursued them. The little moles rushed right into the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone, not stopping at all. When the three little moles turned around, they saw the pursuers beyond the restricted zone stomping their feet in rage.

Pava's uncle was a Silvermane Guards officer, and with his help, the little moles made their way to the camp's depths &mdash; the location where Drake's treasure had hinted. "I'm not heartless, Pava, but couldn't you get your uncle to arrest all those bad guys?" Carbine was still enraged. "They kidnapped you, which is against the law."

"Don't worry. They're not getting away from it." Pava's uncle had helped the Moles countless times in perilous situations, and he was their most dependable collaborator. "Leave these things to us adults. Your adventure is still one step away from being completed. Go finish it."

{{Color|h|nobold=1|"The industrious and smart soldier will check the 4 gun stands every day to make sure there are exactly 3 guns per stand, no more and no less."}} Becky read from Drake's last message.

"Hmm... would someone really bury treasure in a restricted zone?" Pava's uncle never believed in the invisible treasure because this was where the army was stationed. Neither Drake from hundreds of years ago nor anyone centuries in the future could have buried unknown treasures in the middle of the army.

"Since it's an invisible treasure, there has to be a means to find it." Carbine paused for a moment, convinced that he already knew where the invisible treasure was hidden.

''&mdash; Have you got any ideas on how he will find the treasure, my young readers?''
