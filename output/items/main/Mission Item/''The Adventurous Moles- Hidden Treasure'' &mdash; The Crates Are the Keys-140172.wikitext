Carbine rushed to hide behind the crates used to store Geomarrow. "They took Pava!" This terrible thought kept echoing in his mind. "Maybe we shouldn't be looking for Drake's treasure in the first place." However, regret won't bring Pava back. Carbine needed to think of something to do to help.

Becky placed her hand on Carbine's shoulder, trying to calm him down. Just a few days ago, they were eating suncakes and talking about how to spend the holiday. Now, they were involved in an unexpected conspiracy. Why did those who attended the gathering want the treasure? Where was Drake's underground hidden door? And what would they do to Pava... She couldn't answer any of these questions.

"Hold on." Becky picked up a piece of paper. It looked like something used by the school they went to, which meant it was left by Pava. "There's nothing on the paper, and it's sticky."

"Sticky? It might be Pava's invisible ink." Carbine recalled the small things he made in the secret base, and how he used invisible ink to write things down. If the text was written with brine, you heat the paper. If it was written with white candle, use charcoal powder to make the text visible... "Let me have a go!"

And sure enough, the piece of paper carried secret information. Carbine moved the paper under the light of a miner's lamp, and a line of fragmented text appeared.

The text was just some words pieced together, which is of no surprise, given Pava couldn't see what he was writing. He had to make things simple and space out the letters. Becky gave it a quick thought and it dawned on her that Pava was sharing clues that could lead to Drake's hidden door.

"The crates are the key. Opening the hidden door is easier than doing chores." Becky read with excitement.

''&mdash; Dear readers, do you know what she should do?''
