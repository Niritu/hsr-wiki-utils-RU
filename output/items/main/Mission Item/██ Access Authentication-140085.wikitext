|description = A mysterious card used to access an unknown facility. Its corner has been chipped away and the letters on it have become unrecognizable. But when you hold it under the light at a certain angle, you can see the faint letters that read "██." ''"When you run your fingers past the incomprehensible letters, you can't help but think: Maybe this card is one of those collector's edition things. Could it be that having all the cards can grant you the power to summon... that Aeon?"''
