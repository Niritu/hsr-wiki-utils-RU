{{Description|''"An eagle borne on mighty wings will never miss the cliffs it once fell from, and a full-mast ship will never miss the beach where she once ran aground.<br />And you, my child, know that the past is as intangible as a hazy mirage.<br />But everything you are experiencing right now will surely be etched in stone by those who come after."''}}
