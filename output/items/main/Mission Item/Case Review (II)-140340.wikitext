<div align="center">{{Color|Keyword|Case Review (II)}}</div>
Sparkle arrived at a clothes shop to purchase a tie, but was killed in the changing room. The police had determined that only three people could have killed Sparkle at the time &mdash; Wright the Pepeshi staff, Zhongshan the foxian gambler, and Lefton the Intellitron mogul.

Wright was often mocked by Sparkle due to their short stature. Zhongshang had once lost to Sparkle in a gamble and had to give her their family heirloom. And lastly, Lefton was Sparkle's biggest commercial competitor.

All three of them have sufficient motives. Who exactly was Sparkle's murderer?
