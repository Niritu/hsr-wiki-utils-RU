I found Asta, but she didn't seem to know much about it. Fortunately, {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Hinkel of the Department of Ecology}} and someone from the Department of Insight are nearby, which is more or less a clue./

I found Asta, but she didn't seem to know much about it either. Fortunately, Hinkel of the Department of Ecology and Emily of the Department of Insight are nearby, which is more or less a clue.) (/

Hinkel is troubled by the confidence crisis within the space station. We had a brief chat, and she speculated that what Herta is looking for is a Wubbaboo, but this isn't certain yet. In the end, {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Hinkel recommended me to look for Adler}}. Apparently he is the person who knows the most about Curios in the Department of Ecology./

In addition to Hinkel from the Department of Ecology, I also asked Emily from the Department of Insight for clues about the missing Curio. She told me that it is said that there are similar lifeforms in The Xianzhou Alliance.) (/

The confidence crisis Hinkel mentioned concerned me a little. Asta and I chatted about this topic, and I unexpectedly learned that there had been a series of researchers' disappearances on the space station recently. But I keep feeling like something has slipped between the cracks. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|I should ask if anyone from the Department of Insight has also sought any clues regarding missing Curios}}./

I ran into Arlan on my way to find Adler. He seemed to be looking for Adler too, so I decided to go with him.) (/

Adler was saved by us when he was attacked. I stated our purpose, and he seemed to have an epiphany from my words. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|I think I understood something from the words of someone Asta mentioned before.}}/

Adler was saved by us when he was attacked. I stated our purpose, and he seemed to have an epiphany from my words. This should have something to do with the lifeform bearing similarities to the Xianzhou Alliance mentioned by {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Emily from the Department of Insight.}}/

Adler was saved by us when he was attacked. I stated our purpose, and he said that the Wubbaboo suspected by Hinkel of the Department of Ecology and the heliobus that Emily of the Department of Insight heard about were both energy lifeforms, and he seemed to have some sort of revelation from them.)

(/

Arlan is secretly investigating something, and after saving Adler, I tried to get to the bottom of it, but he seemed to be hiding something./

Arlan was secretly investigating something, so after saving Adler, I tried to get to the bottom of it, but he seemed to be hiding something. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|I guess this has something to do with the missing researchers that Asta mentioned before.}}/

Arlan was secretly investigating something, so after saving Adler, I tried to get to the bottom of it, but he seemed to be hiding something. I did some poking around, and sure enough, he was investigating the series of researchers' disappearances that Asta mentioned before. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|With Adler's help, he discovered that every disappearance was accompanied by spontaneous human combustion.}}) (/

Herta assigned me to investigate energy lifeforms similar to Wubbaboos and heliobi. The spontaneous human combustion occuring among the researchers is a thorny problem. However, Adler already seems to have a bold conjecture. His intuition is usually very accurate, and we can look forward to how his predictions play out.)
