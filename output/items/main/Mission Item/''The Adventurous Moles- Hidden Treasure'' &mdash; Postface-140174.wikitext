The Moles will solve the mystery, no matter how difficult it is, and "Drake's Invisible Treasure" is nearing its conclusion.

The three little moles displayed their investigative skills again in this adventure. And of course, you, our fourth little mole, are the most important contributor to the adventure!

Young readers who have read The Adventurous Moles know that this is only the beginning of their exploits, and the little moles have many more adventures ahead of them! Drake, the story's great adventurer, is content with a fantastic adventure, even if it is only once in a lifetime. However, such an adventure is not enough for our young readers.

What gives me the right to say such a thing? Is it because I'd like to keep selling books? Of course, this is a factor. But, more importantly, I want to give my young readers "the experience of adventure without the peril of it." I don't want you to meet any bad guys in real life, and I don't want you to be trapped in a crisis like the three little moles.

Parents frequently write to me. "I don't want my children to read your stories anymore because they will just follow The Moles and embark on dangerous adventures." Such letters often baffle me. If I were irresponsible enough, I would tell them, "Give it a shot! Humans are supposed to go on adventures." However, given the parent's concern, I would respond, "The safest adventure I can think of is merely going on an adventure at home by reading a book without taking any risks. What, not even such an adventure is permitted?"

Authors are notorious for complaining about their hardships in the postface of their works, so please forgive me if I do the same. You followed in the footsteps of the three little moles in this adventure story, even though you did not encounter the dreadful gatherers (after all, I made it up), but you used your curiosity and ingenuity to complete the best adventure, right?

That is precisely what I am looking for.

I want to congratulate you on finishing your adventure once again, and please allow me to shout out The Moles' slogan!
