|description = In Mr. Xiyan's story, this is the weapon you and {TEXTJOIN#59} managed to forge. You can tell at a glance that this dark and faded {TEXTJOIN#61} has a legendary past.<br />It's actually a toy laser gun belonging to Mr. Xiyan's little niece. Then he ran its batteries flat, and she didn't talk to him for three days. (He returned the toy laser gun to her after replacing the batteries. They have now reconciled.)
