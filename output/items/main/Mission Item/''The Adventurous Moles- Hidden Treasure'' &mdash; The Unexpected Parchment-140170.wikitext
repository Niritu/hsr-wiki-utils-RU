The old Silvermane Guard flask that Carbine was eyeing was hardly a valuable item. The Moles looked around the auction hall, no one else raising their hand to bid in competition.

"Going once, going twice. Sold! This old flask goes to the young boy with the glasses" said the auctioneer as he banged his gavel.

"You shelled out 12 shield for a flask? I truly don't comprehend collectors' tastes like yours." Pava scratched his curly hair. "I still have the limited Silvermane Guard festival edition of this flask at home, which I can sell to you for a low price."

The Moles paid, collected the antique flask, and exited the room. A continuous flow of people passed by the outdoor café. There had been an antique craze since the archaeological team made the Great Adventurer Drake's will public, and everyone was hunting for clues to the 'invisible treasure chests.' It also irritated Carbine, an antique collector whose pastime had gotten more expensive.

"Look what I found in this kettle! A piece of parchment!" Becky opened the kettle. "No way. The paper references invisible treasure chests, but does that mean it has something to do with Drake...?"

"Shh!" Pava suddenly lowered his voice and said, "Someone is watching us."

Carbine pulled a reflective lens from his backpack. The lens reflected the sight behind him. He saw no one pursuing The Moles. "Hey, why am I not seeing anything?"

Pava may be physically strong, but that didn't mean he's a simpleton. He extended his hand, pointed to a location in the open-air café, and remarked, {{Color|h|nobold=1|"It's there. There are lots of tables and chairs in the open-air café, but only that location may conceal a person."}}

Carbine and Becky looked in amazement at the open-air café, and they quickly realized what Pava was saying and were impressed by him.

''&mdash; Do you know where he's pointing at, my young readers?''
