Olga,

How has our son been? I hope his illness has gotten better.

My symptoms are still worsening. So, for safety concerns, we still can't see each other for the time being.

I've found a job that should be able to keep our family afloat.

I've always been sturdier than others, ever since I was a child. Even when I become sick, I'm still strong. So, no need to worry about me.

Take good care of yourself and our kid.
