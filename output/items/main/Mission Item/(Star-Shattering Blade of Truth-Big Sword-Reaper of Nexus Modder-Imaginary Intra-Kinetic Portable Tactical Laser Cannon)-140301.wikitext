|description = In Mr. Xiyan's story, this is the weapon you and (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe) managed to forge. You can tell at a glance that this (Star-Shattering Blade of Truth/Big Sword/Reaper of Nexus Modder/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon), emitting an aura of pure danger, is no ordinary item.<br />It's actually a toy laser gun belonging to Mr. Xiyan's little niece. He forcibly got the toy off her to use it as a prop, and she didn't talk to him for three days. (He returned the toy laser gun to her later and apologized sincerely.)
