Welcome, kid! Join the Adventurous Moles and put your knowledge and courage to the test with Becky, Carbine, and Pava as you become the fourth little mole. The book is divided into four parts, each with its own unique story, and a riddle will appear at the end of each part for you to solve.

The adventure this time is different from The Moles' past visits to distant jungles, icy mountains, and temple ruins. The backdrop of this story is a place all of our little moles are familiar with &mdash; Belobog. During this adventure, a group of archaeologists have uncovered the will left by Drake, the great adventurer of Belobog, in which he stated:

''"I've enjoyed almost 50 years of adventures and have been to almost every destination in and out of Belobog. Along the way, I've collected a plethora of exotic treasures. Some of which I donated to the Belobog Museum, while the most dangerous and enigmatic of which I have hidden. The treasure's location was drawn on a treasure map, which was then divided into many pieces and placed in 'invisible treasure chests.' Only the person who finds all of the treasure chests will then be able to find my treasure."''

This time in The Adventurous Moles, it's up to you, our fourth little mole, to find all the pieces of the story. {{Color|h|nobold=1|If you follow the hints on the list, they will lead you to the correct locations, where you will be able to gather the book pages. The pages conceal clues to the riddles that will lead you to the invisible treasure chests...}} By collecting all the pages, not only will you complete a copy of ''The Adventurous Moles: Hidden Treasure'', but you will also discover Drake the Great Adventurer's treasure.

Every clue in the story may hold the key to understanding the riddle, so think carefully and don't dismiss any clues. Don't be concerned if your acute mind briefly fails you. As long as you follow your intuition, you will find the answer. We have also prepared several helpful resources for the adventure, which are printed at the end of the book for your convenience.

Are you ready to embark on an exciting adventure, little moles?
