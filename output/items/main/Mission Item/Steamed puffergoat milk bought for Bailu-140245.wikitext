|description = Puffergoat milk, also known as Gentle Halcyon milk, is a specialty of the Xianzhou Alliance.<br />The milk is difficult to preserve and rarely seen outside Xianzhou.<br />It is sweet after warming without needing extra sugar, but it becomes bitter after cooling, so it must be drunk while hot.
