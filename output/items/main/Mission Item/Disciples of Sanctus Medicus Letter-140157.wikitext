Dear Ziyi,

It's an emergency. To cut a long story short, I need you to apprehend a nurse from the Alchemy Commission named Banxia. I have seen her resume in the department and thought she would be of some help in medicine refining and Elevation... Didn't think she has the means to escape the Alchemy Commission's delve and take a list with her.

I can't tell you what's on the list, but you must retrieve it. You've seen Banxia, and I trust you. Bring her and the list back. Or, at the very least, destroy the list.

According to intel, Banxia had already left with the Dragon Lady before the blockade of the delves. We can only get in touch with a few disciples outside the delve. If you encounter other disciples, give the letter and prescription to them and find the traitor together. This matter is our highest priority.

Mercy of Sanctus Medicus!
