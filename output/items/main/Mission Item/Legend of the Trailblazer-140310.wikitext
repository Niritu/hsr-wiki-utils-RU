<div align="center">Chapter 1: Calamity Ensnares Commission of Alchemy</div>

...

And the Alchemy Commission was plagued with threats internal and external &mdash; the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were wreaking havoc within, while Abominations and the Ambrosial Arbor loomed beyond. Seeing the crisis, (Trailblazer) yet laughed loudly at the companions behind them. The heroes were confused as to the reason of the laughter, and (Trailblazer) calmly explained &mdash; "I laugh at the folly of these Abominations of Abundance, and at idiocy of the Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus."

{{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 4)}} cupped their hands in praise &mdash; "{{MC|f=My sister|m=My brother}}, you couldn't have said it better! I have heard of your fierce battle against the Ruin Legion on "Ya Li Luo-VI" &mdash; even with the help of the Doomsday Beast, the Legion could not escape an overwhelming defeat. And now, these Abominations and demon have schemed and plotted, yet the best they could summon was an Ebon Deer that stands no chance against a mighty warrior such as you!"

The companions exchanged smiles, their morale renewed afresh. At this moment of high spirits, they heard a whooshing sound in the distance &mdash; the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus wielded colossal crossbows, firing a steady stream of projectiles in a play to catch the companions off guard. {{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 3)}} casually caught the flying arrows, and tossed them back to their owners! Screams and screeches rose in tandem, for these dishonorable scoundrels were now having a taste of their own medicine.

{{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 1)}} and {{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 2)}} looked at each other and instantly shared the same thought: "We must not let others look down on the two of us." Then, they worked their internal qi, made a double jump onto the air to fly up, and pounced on the enemy. Of course, the chaos that ensued is another story altogether!

...

<div align="center">Chapter 2: Nameless Battles Author of Plagues</div>

...

It was said that the Ebon Deer had a hide of iron and hooves of bronze, impervious to sword and spear. Its eyes glowed like burning lamps, and its cry whistled through the air like the wailing of a terrible ghost. Any ordinary person who encounters such a monster will surely be scared out of their wits.

(Trailblazer) and {{MC|f=her|m=his}} companions, however, were not fazed in the least. Esteemed audience, can you guess why? Because the four heroes in this story each have their own special abilities and unique skills, and the fighting spirit and endurance to match. Defeating the wicked beast of Abundance was but a moment's effort for our heroes!

For it is said that {{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 1)}} stood eight feet tall and spanned eight feet across the waist. When they lowered their head to look down upon the Ebon Deer, it was akin to a giant looking at a child. They had cultivated their martial skills to perfection &mdash; the sharpest of blades are futile against such a person. Seeing that its antlers could not gore the hero, the Deer stomped its bronze hooves on the ground with a howl, and branches of the Ambrosial Arbor sprouted out in all directions, firmly wrapping around {{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 1)}}'s limbs. For a time, the two were at a standstill. It was at this moment that {{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 2)}} entered the melee. They raised their giant fists, the size of an aurumaton's hands, and pounded relentlessly. The monster's hide was thick, but a moment had not passed before the shock from {{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 2)}}'s heavy blows delivered grave internal injuries, and blood flowed from its nostrils. As most can guess, internal injuries don't always have external manifestations &mdash; though there was nary a scratch on the skin of the beast, its insides were already beaten to a rotten pulp. The Ebon Deer would not last more than a few years with such wounds.

But (Trailblazer) knew well such a monstrosity, though mortally wounded, could not be allowed to roam freely and terrorize the citizenry. With a gesture from {{MC|f=her|m=him}}, {{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 3)}} sprung into action, the sword in their hand spinning as it dispatched the vines grappling {{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 1)}}. With a flash of the sword and flick of the wrist, {{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 4)}} dashed straight towards the enemy, and sent the Ebon Deer to the ground with just one blow! As it turned out, the beast was susceptible to fire, and {{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 4)}} was a seasoned fire user. Quick as a lightning flash, this monster that had stricken fear in countless Clouds Knights fell to the ground at the hands of our heroes, never to rise again!

<div align="center">Chapter 3: Traveler Treasures Heart of Scions</div>

...

It was said the High Elder (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe) was the living embodiment of nature's pinnacle and the breathing epitome of heaven's zenith, and was set by divine destiny to be born into this mortal world. (Trailblazer) reckons "a diamond must be cut and polished before it can shine &mdash; without a wise teacher and good friends, (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe) could well join the dark side and follow in the footsteps of the predecessor, Imbibitor Lunae." Though (Trailblazer) had no blood relation to the High Elder, they had the responsibility to raise the High Elder. And so, {{MC|f=she|m=he}} summoned their four companions to inquire about how to best educate the young (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe), desirous of giving him a bright future.

{{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 1)}} said: "This is the future leader of the Vidyadhara &mdash; if he has not mastered the art of warfare and combat, how can he live up to the mandate of the heaven or claim earthly glory by war? How will he maintain his power over his people? I hear that General Jing Yuan excels in the art of war and is the Sword Champion's disciple. Why not ask the general to be the teacher?"

{{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 2)}} said: "That won't do! How can the cultivation of an outstanding talent be confined to violence? It's known that Master Diviner Fu Xuan's omniscia spares none. She is a genius at tactics and strategy and is also literate and eloquent to a fault. Besides, she enjoys all pedagogical endeavors. If Master Diviner Fu can be the teacher, (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe) will become adept in the ways of the cosmos and of worldly affairs!"

{{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 3)}} shook their head heavily: "It's said you need a famous teacher to train a great student &mdash; how can a hero be cultivated by such mediocre characters? If I may offer a better suggestion &mdash; I have caught wind that there is a certain genius named Madam Herta, whose space station orbits The Blue. She has even gained the favor of Nous the Wisdomwalker and reached the level of becoming their Emanator. Her domain, the space station, is home to 72 sages, three thousand researchers, and more Curios than could ever be counted! (Trailblazer) could inform Herta that (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe) is a Curio from far across the stars and ask for her audience this way. When you meet her, convince her with rarity and appeal to her with cuteness. That would surely pique Madam Herta's curiosity and make her eager to become (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe)'s teacher."

{{Color|h|nobold=1|(Warrior 4)}} sat and pondered deeply with their eyes downcast, and after a few moments looked up and said: "As the saying goes, 'You are the company you keep.' I heard that on "Ya Li Luo-VI" there is a child prodigy named Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, who is wise beyond her years &mdash; she even recruited persons of upstanding character to form a gallant group called The Moles. Being tutored by an adult would surely spoil (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe)'s childlike innocence and simplicity &mdash; why not entrust him to The Moles and let him grow into his own person in a natural way, spending his childhood in careless play? So, what does (Trailblazer) think? When it comes to pre-school education, aren't the Moles the best? After all, the Moles are supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!"

After hearing everyone's eager contributions of balderdash, (Trailblazer) firmly believed that with the combined efforts of their companions and (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe)'s innate talent, they would surely be able to raise (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe) as an outstanding High Elder of the Vidyadhara.

...

<div align="center">Chapter 4: Dragonlord Commands Wrath of Seas</div>

...

After (Trailblazer) completed the trial and found the dragon egg under the guidance of the wise Vidyadhara spirits, (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe) descended and subsequently provided powerful support for the group. The people often saw a heroic and dashing {{MC|f=girl|m=boy}} carrying out justice together with an adorable child, who wielded a long lance and stood floating on fortuitous clouds. This hero also joined hands with many a valiant leader on the Luofu and beyond, determined to eradicate the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and the evil of the Ambrosial Arbor.

One day (Trailblazer) and (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe) came to Scalegorge Waterscape and gazed there upon the shimmering waters of the vast ancient sea, like a drop of empyreal jade, where all things that ever were are lost to the billowing waves. It should be known that the Vidyadhara are born from the ancient sea, and to the ancient sea they are destined to return. The sight of their old home filled (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe) with elation, and they could hardly wait to put down the lance, untie their red silk sash at their waist, and go frolic at the water's edge.

Being of the dragon race, visiting the water gives the Vidyadhara quietude, clarity, and even epiphany. The young High Elder began playing with their red silk sash in the sea, enjoying the water as if it were second nature. However, it unintentionally started to cast a cloudhymn, its magical notes stirring this heavenscape into gloomy darkness and lifting giant waves into the air. The Abominations hiding nearby could not endure the relentless barrage, and they came out in droves expecting to face the wrath of an earth-shattering giant. Instead, they saw a small child, and they were filled with an indomitable rage:

"If this small child is already capable of such feats, how can we hope to survive when they are fully grown!?" And then these fiends born from the Arbor showed their claws and approached (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe), vowing to exterminate the hatchling right there and then.

(Trailblazer) rose up anxiously to protect the young one, shouting: "Harm not my child!"

Yet (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe) remained calmed and composed, and simply shouted: "Part!" With the raising of (Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe)'s red sash, the tides of Scalegorge Waterscape moved as though they were alive, obeying the command to part and never to close back. The Abominations, with their murderous fury, were all pulled into the bottomless ravine between the waters &mdash; even their bones were torn out of existence! If any of you have the opportunity to visit Scalegorge Waterscape, the tide that parted and never closed back is a living testament to the unfathomable power of this little Vidyadhara!

<div align="center">Chapter 5: Xianzhou Laments Woes of Age</div>

...

Ladies and gentlemen, it is important to know that when a divine weapon takes shape, it is often heralded by extraordinary signs. Mountains crumble, rivers run dry, and blood-soaked rain accompanies the wailing of ghosts. Without such phenomena, its divine nature would not be revealed. Through countless hardships, (Trailblazer) had forged (Star-Shattering Blade of Truth/Big Sword/Reaper of Nexus Modder/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon). As it emerged into the world, the heavens and earth grew solemn, delves trembled, and the balance of the Meridian Pin faltered. Whether it be the craftmasters of the Artisanship Commission or the plants and trees of the Alchemy Commission, all sentient beings with or without emotions rejoiced at the birth of this weapon capable of vanquishing Lord Ravagers. Yet, they also keenly sensed the profound death and destruction it will bring forth in the future. At this moment, sorrow filled the hearts of plants and trees, and tears flew from young and old alike.

Even the renowned Master Gongshu, who was accustomed to witnessing the creation of exceptional weapons, couldn't help but exclaim when he sensed the murderous aura emanating from the divine weapon: "In the current ranking of armaments on Xianzhou, (Star-Shattering Blade of Truth/Big Sword/Reaper of Nexus Modder/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon) deserves to be at the forefront!"

(Trailblazer) was intrigued by his words and asked, "I am but a simple and ignorant one. Pray tell, good sir, if there be talk of an armament ranking, surely there must be other marvels of weaponry aboard the Xianzhou that are worthy of my attention!"

"When it comes to divine armament and marvels of weaponry, I am indeed the expert. Allow me to share some insights with the {{MC|f=young heroine|m=young hero}}."

"In terms of sheer power, it is undoubtedly the Devastator Glaive wielded by General Jing Yuan. This weapon was crafted from the remnants of the Lux Arrow, which was shot by the Reignbow to extinguish the embers of fallen stars. It weighs a staggering 13,500 catties! When held in the general's hand, it may appear like an ordinary Cloud Knight's glaive of moderate length. But when unleashed in its full glory, held by the spiritus summoned by the general, this weapon defies the heavens and the earth. A single strike has the power to sunder mountains and cleave peaks!"

"When it comes to sapience, the foremost recommendation is the spherical astrolabe wielded by the esteemed master diviner. This wondrous artifact resembles a wheel, constantly rotating. Embedded within it are 108 jade abaci, attuned to the profound patterns of the Matrix of Prescience. It can divine fortunes and evil, discern auspicious and ominous signs, and unveil the most prudent courses of action. Truly, it is a brilliant beacon illuminating the nebulous mysteries of pasts and futures! A treasure, indeed!"

"When it comes to precision, there is only one that stands out &mdash; the Bow of Spirit wielded by Madam Yukong, the Helm Master of the Sky-Faring Commission. When the bowstring is drawn, it becomes one with the archer, guiding the darting arrows unerringly to their targets, piercing hearts with every shot!"

Upon hearing this, (Trailblazer) was filled with joy. "So many awe-inspiring marvels of weaponry are aboard the Xianzhou and yet none of them are put to good use. You see, they are a gift. A gift to the foes of evil. Why not use these weapons? One does not simply lock away their precious. Why not lend them to me and my friends to deal with the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and drive away the Ruin Legion? With these weapons of power in hand, it would just be a piece of cake, wouldn't it?"

...

''(At this point of the story, I'm seriously finding it difficult to continue. If I boast too much about the weapons on Luofu, it would actually imply that their masters have been spectators and didn't want to do any work throughout the whole affair... How can I possibly make that narrative work and tie it all together? Well, forget it. {{MC|f=Young lady|m=Young lad}}, I can't continue with this script, so I'll just put my signature on it and give it to you. Consider it a collector's item. Treasure it!)''

<div align="center">Chapter 6: Trailblazer Fails Sanctum of Exaltation</div>

...

Though Phantylia, the master primus of all evil, was eliminated, the Ambrosial Arbor it poisoned was on the verge of losing control. This towering plant sprouted rapidly, and the Abominations of Abundance hiding in its branches and veins poured into the human realm as they gained bodies of corporeal flesh and blood.

(Trailblazer) knew that, should the Ambrosial Arbor be allowed to grow to its full, the Xianzhou Luofu shall be reduced to a ship of the dead. Faced with veritable tsunamis of Abominations of Abundance, (Trailblazer) signaled the band of heroes to retreat while providing cover for them.

At that precipitous moment, {{MC|f=she|m=he}} yelled: "(Will this blow pierce through the stars?/I'll be back!/Oops, was it my line?/Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!)" Like a lightning bolt that slammed into the ground, the light that exploded out of (Star-Shattering Blade of Truth/Big Sword/Reaper of Nexus Modder/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon) engulfed all, stabbing toward and tearing apart the Ambrosial Arbor, destroying the very sky itself. For a moment, the ground toppled, and the sky trembled in the Xianzhou's countless delves, as if the Reignbow had returned to shoot down stars, as if the death of the divine wood sent up a cataclysmic dust storm.

After the clouds dissipated a few days later and the Xianzhou returned to peace, the Cloud Knights guarding the Arbor sought unceasingly for (Trailblazer) and yet could not find a single trace of them, just like the ephemeral theophany of the Reignbow. When General Jing Yuan heard the news, he could not help but lament and shed tears worthy for a hero. However, though the general is wise, he did not divine that legendary characters such as (Trailblazer) will never die in the company of demons and crowns. Blessed by the Cloudstrider, (Trailblazer) had already left the devastation and quietly started on a new hero's journey. The Ruin Legion still ravages the starry seas, and the worlds waiting for salvation are endless. The legend of the heroes of the Trailblaze continues on!

As it is said:<br />Serene was the Xianzhou, free from harm. Quiet was the palace, rich in charm.<br />Until the demons breached the gate, leaving the palace bloodied by fate.<br />Then comes a {{MC|m=hero|f=heroine}}, tall and strong. Flesh and iron, seven feet long.<br />Evil minions fall to {{MC|m=his|f=her}} might. Under {{MC|m=his|f=her}} staff, they bleed in flight.<br />Mounting the clouds, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} pursues all foes. Riding the dragon, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} purges all woes.<br />Towards the sky, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} splits through. Onto the arbor, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} strikes true.
