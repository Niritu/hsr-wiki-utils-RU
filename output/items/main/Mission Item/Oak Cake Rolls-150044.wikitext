|description = Legend has it that poor inhabitants of border planets would add wood chips to their bread to satiate their hunger. Over time, this practice evolved into a peculiar tradition among aristocrats, symbolizing a "reverence" for the humble past.<br />This product features a variety of botanical additives, closely resembling an oak branch in terms of both appearance and composition, and only the most ambitious and determined individuals can consume it.
