|description = The token of the Trickery Titan. Like the Titan's mythical form, the coin has two faces, one smiling, one crying, effortlessly flipping in the air. It was originally used by fraudsters as counterfeit coins to replace the Balance Coins. Fearing that such actions would invoke Talanton's punishment, they crafted it in the image of Zagreus, seeking the blessing of Trickery.<br />However, as time passed, these coins became more precious than the Balance Coins due to the difficulty of their creation, becoming a favorite collectible of nobles and artists &mdash; though this could also be one of Zagreus' tricks.
