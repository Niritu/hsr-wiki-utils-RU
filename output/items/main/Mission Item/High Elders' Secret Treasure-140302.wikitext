|description = Mr. Xiyan shoves a jewelry box into your hands. The box is full of fake emerald pendants made from green beer bottle glass and fake diamond rings made of glass marbles. He says this is the high elders' secret treasure. You say there's no way that's the case. He says he's the scriptwriter, not you. You decide to get him back later.
