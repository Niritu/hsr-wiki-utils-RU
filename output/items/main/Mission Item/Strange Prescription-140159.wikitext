'''Strange Prescription''' is a [[Mission Item]].

<div align="center">{{Color|Keyword|Semblance Reversion Essence}}</div>
Dear disciples,

After converting, each of you has been consuming the treasure nutrients and learning the doctrines diligently, and many of you have succeeded in forming internal alchemy. Our great cause will soon be accomplished. I am very pleased.

Some talented disciples have ascended and gained the appearance of true immortals, such as the Sanctus Medicus Semblance and the Sprig Semblance. I will grant you the prescription of the Semblance Reversion Essence, which allows you to revert your form to its original appearance.

Recipe:<br />''<div align="center">5 mace of Daiyu angelica</div>''<br />''<div align="center">2 mace of Tian Dong</div>''<br />''<div align="center">3 mace of dragon scale coral from the Lunarescent Depths</div>''<br />''<div align="center">1 mace of cyan poria</div>''<br />''<div align="center">1 mace of Mara-Struck bone dust (do not harm your brethren for this ingredient)</div>''<br />''<div align="center">Add some red sage collagen and the root of Dragon's Tears, and then knead them into pills.</div>''

Being mara-struck is in fact a stepping stone to ascension given to us by the Sanctus Medicus. It can be slowed down, but it cannot be avoided. If you take the Semblance Reversion Elixir too frequently, its potency will weaken and eventually fade completely. Be careful.

Mercy of Sanctus Medicus, the Arbor's new growth.
