Sparkle had intended to receive three valiant warriors under her employ at the Goldhammer Residence today. However, upon their arrival at the Goldhammer Residence, all they found was her body, slain by what was apparently a hammer.

The three valiants &mdash; Lefton, Zhongshan, and Wright &mdash; all had motives to kill Sparkle, and the killer was sure to be one of them.

Investigations revealed that Lefton had lost an arm, Zhongshan suffered grave facial injuries, and Wright's legs were broken. Perhaps these clues could be of help in solving the case.

So, who exactly was Sparkle's murderer?
