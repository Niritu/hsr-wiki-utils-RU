<br />Speaking of Fyxestroll Garden, there's a place within its boundaries known as Locufox Forest, which was built by foxian craftsmen for the enjoyment of the garden's visitors. Over the years, they expanded it with elegant buildings, marking it with exceptional opulence.<br />General Teng Xiao entered this area, but instead of seeing its beauty, he found it in ruins and desolation, filled with eerie and sinister atmospheres. He wondered how a place like this could fall into such disrepair when Fyxestroll Garden had only been completed decades prior. He suspected this was the work of heliobi's illusions.<br />He arrived at a courtyard and was greeted by a young servant who bowed and offered him a food box. When he examined it closely, he noticed that the young servant had milky eyes, indicating impairment of sight.<br />"The food is simple, as a mere token of goodwill. You've come a long way, hungry and tired, so my master wishes for you to dine before we discuss matters further."<br />"I've passed through at least ten moon gates to get here, but in all my visits to Fyxestroll Garden, I don't remember encountering so many gates. If your master wishes to negotiate, they should do so openly and with respect. Where does it find the audacity to play tricks on me?"<br />The young servant remained unperturbed by Teng Xiao's stern words, as if deaf to his thunderous reprimand.<br />"With the tricks your master has played with dark arts, if I were to eat from this box, I'd probably find a lump of black mud in my mouth." With a flick of his sleeves, General Teng Xiao tossed the food box onto the ground. Sure enough, it grew spider-like limbs and skittered away.<br />"General, with your divine insight and clear vision, you've already passed the test. As a token of acknowledgment that you have just passed the test, my master wishes to present you with a gift," answered the blind servant calmly.<br />"In the side room, there are various chests to choose from. Please select the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|least expensive one}}."<br />"As for the porcelain vases at the entrance..." The blind young servant's face twisted into a disturbing smile, no longer resembling that of an innocent child. "My master said:<br />'General, after enduring so much on the battlefield, I'm sure you'd show compassion for the wounded and fallen soldiers. Please {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|break all}} the {{Color|heliobus|nobold=1|cerulean vases}}. As for the {{Color|fire|nobold=1|vermilion ones}}, they must {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|remain intact}}.'"<br />"It seems that we are guaranteed to strike this deal." The general let out a long sigh. He looked up and found that the clear moon had disappeared, replaced by thick, enveloping clouds.<br />"Let's hope your master doesn't come to regret its decision." Teng Xiao strode forward, pushing open the final gate.<br />...
