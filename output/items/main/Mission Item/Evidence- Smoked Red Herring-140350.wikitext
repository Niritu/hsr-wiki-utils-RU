|description = This "evidence" is obviously something comical Sparkle made. To avoid you thinking that you wasted time investigating this useless evidence, here's a recipe &mdash;<br />Smoke the red herring (or any other type of preserved fish) until it turns golden on both sides. Place it into a dish, remove all bones, then crush the meat. Add raw eggs into the frying pan and fry it until well done, then add vegetables you like and fry that too. Then, add in the crushed smoked red herring and day-old rice. Add some salt (be very careful with how much you put in! There's already preserved fish in it!), stir-fry evenly, then plate.<br />And voila! Here's a Smoked Red Herring Fried Rice.<br />You're welcome.
