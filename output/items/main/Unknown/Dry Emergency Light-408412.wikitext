|description = An emergency light from the outworld civilization of Insumousu. This small portable lamp requires no source of energy. Simply soak it in brine with 5% salt concentration and it will shine for hours. It is actually the luminescent fishing rod antennae on the dorsal fin of a Thalassa lightfish. In ancient Insumousu, only the bravest fishers dared to hunt these dreadful creatures. Now, however, these fish are being cultivated on an industrial scale.
