|description = A family photo taken somewhere not on the Xianzhou Luofu. Evidently, this Disciple of Sanctus Medicus came from a different world. He came here either chasing the distant idea of immortality or to cure a disease. He has a bright smile in the photo, drastically different to how he looked when you met him on the street.
