|description = According to ancient Xianzhou records, those who have ascended can summon lightning and command the wind. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus claimed to have inherited the way of the gods. By demonstrating godly power, the disciples gathered large numbers of worshipers in secret. Branches of lightning coil around this wooden staff &mdash; could it be that the disciples were indeed no mere mortals?
