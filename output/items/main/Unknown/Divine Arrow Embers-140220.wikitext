|description = At the end of the Third Denizens of Abundance War, Reignbow Arbiter's Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow wiped out everything along the way. The Xianzhou people used the burning embers of the arrow to create many divine objects, and this is one of them. Yukong carries it with her, lest she forgets.
