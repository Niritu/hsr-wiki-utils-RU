Drinking this will make one feel as happy as if they are in a pleasant dream, making it an effective sleep aid. This version of the formula has been adjusted to better suit the tastes of the Xianzhou consumers. It is said that only within the dream of Penacony can one taste the "Inaugural SoulGlad," reputedly as delicious as divine nectar.
