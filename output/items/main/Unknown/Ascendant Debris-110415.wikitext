|description = The Ascended originally intended to bring the world a legacy of kindness, but as the bestowment of Abundance fades, understanding arrives alongside liberation: They were nothing more than a mortal with flesh and blood. Their ability to traverse the skies was nothing but an illusion, and all that remained of their existence was dust and dirt.
