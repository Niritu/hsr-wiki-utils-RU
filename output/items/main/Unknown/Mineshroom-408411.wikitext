|description = Dry fungi prepared from the outworld civilization of Thalassa. This is a type of fungi that exists only at the bottom of Khalnoss' oceans, and harvesting it can be quite dangerous as mishandling may lead to explosions. It tastes good and is extremely nutritious, while its blast radius can reach two meters, making it a high quality food item and an extremely potent weapon.
