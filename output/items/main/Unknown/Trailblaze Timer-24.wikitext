{{Description|The Relic of a Nameless. An item that might have been a pocket watch or a compass.<br />It is said that the first part to break was the chain. It suddenly snapped during a warp jump, the links scattering everywhere.<br />Then, it was the back. Hit by a lead bullet, it was on the verge of falling apart.<br />Lastly, it was the markings on the face. They were gradually worn flat over the long years, becoming no longer visible.<br />It broke countless times and underwent endless repairs. Its former shape was no longer discernible, and only the stilled sharp hands were pointing ever forward.<br /><br />''Take it, Legwork. It's yours now... Then, continue onward...''}}
