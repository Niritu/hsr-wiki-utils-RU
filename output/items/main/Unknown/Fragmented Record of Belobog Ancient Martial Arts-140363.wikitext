{{Description|1="I am almost certain that this booklet was made to look old by being fed to Funeral Worms before soaked in Moo-Moo urine... But the contents written upon its pages might very well be real, as certain contemporary texts can attest. Ah... Don't cry yet, let's get the appraisal fee settled first, thank you." &mdash; Balaway "Miner's Lamp"}}
