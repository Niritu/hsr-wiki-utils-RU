|description = The mechanized wooden training dummy used to teach boxing techniques at the Tiger Boxing Gym. It is said that due to branch closures and the former owner absconding with the funds, angry students who held membership cards resorted to selling it to repay debts. It underwent some modifications, and during sparring sessions, this wooden dummy strikes with extreme force, causing countless injuries.
