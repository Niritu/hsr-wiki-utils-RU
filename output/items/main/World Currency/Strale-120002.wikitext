|effect      = The internal currency of the Xianzhou Alliance with strales as its basic monetary unit. Can be used to purchase goods in Special Stores.
|description = The Xianzhou strales has long been digitized before Xianzhou's interactions with the IPC ever happened. However, there are some collectors who still kept the Celest-Gold coins minted when the Alliance first came into existence. Shaped like the tip of an arrow or a narrow leaf, it seems to allude to the past and future of that civilization.
