Before the activation of important ingenia such as the Matrix of Prescience, craftsmen of the Artisanship Commission will always invite the most qualified masters to perform a warding ceremony with their golden rods, which are dipped in purified water and scattered around the place. It is said that these kinds of rituals decrease ingenia malfunctions by 62.33%.
