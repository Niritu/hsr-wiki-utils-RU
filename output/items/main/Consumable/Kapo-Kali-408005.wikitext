|description = The king of soft drinks. It looks like an azure gravity rainbow with sparkling bubbles surging in the bottle. Hear the crisp "click" when you pop the lid and feel drops of absolute zero freezing your nerve endings... In an instant, you will fall into a dream where the stars rise and fall in the midst of a distant fragrance.
