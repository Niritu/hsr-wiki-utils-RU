|description = Of all the memories collected by the Garden of Recollection, one clip comes from an ancient tribe in a long-gone world. It contains a secret recipe: take the seeds of life, Virtual Particles of energy, and Stone of The Hunt representing the Aeon's Path; grind them into powder and mix to a ratio of 2:5:1 &mdash; you'll get the magical dust. Applying the dust to your body makes you exceptionally agile and swift.
