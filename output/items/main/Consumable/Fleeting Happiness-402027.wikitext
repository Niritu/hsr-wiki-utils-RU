|description = The lengthy meeting reaches an intermission, and you step out to the atrium, finding solace on a bench and releasing a long breath. The sinking sun, accompanied by an evening breeze, brings the sweetness of nature, boldly combatting against the man-made stainless steel behemoth behind you. A stray cat stretches and jumps onto your lap.
