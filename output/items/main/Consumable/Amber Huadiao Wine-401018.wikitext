|description = Made with high-quality glutinous rice and yeast then combined with water from the Lunarescent Depths, the mixture is then stored over time to produce the unique flavor of amber huadiao Wine. Amber huadiao wine gains value with time. It is common to see ten-years-old, hundred-years-old, and even a thousand-years-old amber huadiao wine out in the market. The older it is, the more fragrant it gets.
