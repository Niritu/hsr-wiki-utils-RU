|description = The wars between Cloud Knights and Denizens of Abundance can last for a long time, even across several Amber Eras. The Cloud Knights tend to spend a long time in garrisons and invented many tasty foods for field consumption. The Field Nutrient Bar is easy to carry and particularly sought-after by the troops.<br />The nutrient bar tastes like smoked meat with notes of honey and candy.
