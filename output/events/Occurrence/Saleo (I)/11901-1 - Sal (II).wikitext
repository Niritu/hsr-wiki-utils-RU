{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' In the motel basement, you run into Sal again. He has a pair of red devilish antennae on his head, and his sticky body is corroding the tiles and the walls of the motel. He doesn't pay you any attention, as he is too busy expanding his size.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Not a sound can be heard from every other room. You wonder whether the other guests are all in bed or whether they are in Sal's stomach... You can't help but regret your previous choice.
:"I'm Sal, a devil. My brother is an angel. Which one do you want as your neighbor?"
