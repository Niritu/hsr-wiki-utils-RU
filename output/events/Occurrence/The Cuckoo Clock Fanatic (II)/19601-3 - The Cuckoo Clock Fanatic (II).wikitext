:'''Simulated Universe:''' You run into the cuckoo clock fanatic with the curly chestnut hair again! He greets you enthusiastically when he sees you. You notice that he has just ended a phone conversation with a Black Forest digger...
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "It's you again! We're going to establish the Cuckoo Clock Fan Club! Would you like to experience the charm of other cuckoo clocks?" His enthusiasm is at full power before you are even ready for it.
;(Obtain 1 random Negative Curio)
;(Obtain a 2-star Blessing)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You've received another cuckoo clock! If things go on at this rate, you might one day become a cuckoo clock fanatic yourself. That thought puts you in fear...
;(Discard all Negative Curios of the cuckoo clock series)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' He is devastated. He cannot understand how someone can resist the temptation of a cuckoo clock...
:'''Simulated Universe:''' He leaves with a sigh.
