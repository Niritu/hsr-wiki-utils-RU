{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You enter a circular room where a tree with white branches is tied up in ropes. Its beauty and sacredness, which make it look like a dancing statue, blow you away.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Several soldiers are leaning against the tree, and you are not sure whether they are sleeping. They are pious knights with faces as pale as a sheet.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You can't help moving closer to the tree. You hear the slow, crackling sound of the tree waving to and fro. There is a wooden board next to its roots that reads, "Water it... and it will... bloom."
