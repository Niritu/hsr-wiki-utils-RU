:'''Boothill:''' [[File:Message Boothill 44.png|256px]]
:'''Boothill:''' Haha
:'''Black Swan:''' Haha
:'''March 7th:''' Haha
:'''Boothill:''' And that's after I got help from the Hounds and that man with plaster head
:'''Boothill:''' Who knows when we'd find them all if we looked for them ourselves
:'''Welt:''' That's a shame... Knowing that Fool's habits, I'm afraid we're going to have to keep filtering through the wrong answers.
:'''Argenti:''' Don't fret. The Beauty will guide us!

:'''Argenti:''' My friends, I bring saddening news
:'''Topaz:''' Tell us about it
:'''Argenti:''' This trial of Beauty is especially dangerous
:'''Argenti:''' I've found 145 adorable dolls, but thought they were the Fools' bombs
:'''March 7th:''' Is this really not a trial of Elation or something...?
:'''Argenti:''' No matter what, please be patient, everyone
:'''Argenti:''' I have a feeling that as long as our virtuous patience can persuade Idrila with sincere conviction, even the most difficult of problems will be resolved
:'''Himeko:''' Mr. Argenti is right. Everyone, don't let your guard down

:'''Boothill:''' What's going on? That girly pulling a fast one on us?
:{{DIcon|Warning}} "From Where to View Fireworks" has joined the chat
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' Long time no see everyone!
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 12 Sparkle 04.png|80px|(Door opening sticker)]]
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' Miss Sparkle is delighted that everyone is busying themselves over her!
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' And so, she's had me deliver a message!
:{Choice} Why're you here again?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ??? I didn't add you to the group
::'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' That's Miss Sparkle for you. She doesn't need an invite
:{Choice} I knew it...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I knew this matter wouldn't be so simple...
::'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' You've grown some brain cells, Gray Hair! Miss Sparkle is pleased
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' All right, enough jokes! Miss Sparkle says this message is super important, so listen up
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' There are actually 1000 dolls on the Radiant Feldspar &mdash; to reward everyone's efforts, Miss Sparkle has decided to be magnanimous: She will give the coordinates of the final doll with the bomb to everyone!
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' The time I've allotted to everyone far exceeds ten minutes, but let's all try to hurry up, eh? Something major's going down if you're slowpokes!
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' @Robin I'm sure you don't want everyone to know that "The Family's protection over Penacony has been rendered useless," do you...
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' Hurry up and move out, world-saving heroes!
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 12 Sparkle 03.png|80px|(Lighter sticker)]]
:{{DIcon|Warning}} "From Where to View Fireworks" has left the chat
:'''Robin:''' Everyone, don't be misdirected by her appalling prank
:'''Robin:''' We'll gather at the coordinates
:'''March 7th:''' When we catch her... we'll definitely teach her a lesson she won't soon forget!

:{Choice} Report the situation about the bomb.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' We've got a problem, friends
:'''(Trailblazer):''' There's an imaginary neutron bomb on this ship
:'''March 7th:''' ?
:'''Welt:''' What's happening?
:{Choice} Keep reporting about the bomb.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It's all thanks to that Masked Fool
:{{DIcon|Warning}} "From Where to View Fireworks" has joined the chat
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' Miss Sparkle will explain the situation personally!
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 12 Sparkle 02.png|80px|(Impish lady sticker)]]
:{Choice} How did you get into the group?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ??? I didn't add you to the group
::'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' That's Miss Sparkle for you. She doesn't need an invite
:{Choice} Explain.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Fine, spill it then
::'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' You're good at reading the room. I like that!
:{Choice} Turning yourself in, huh?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How dare you show yourself in this group???
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Time for us to teach you a lesson!
::'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' Sure! Then come through the internet and try to catch me
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' All right, down to business!
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' Is everyone flabbergasted yet? Weren't Miss Sparkle's buttons all confiscated already? Why is the bomb timer still active?
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' Actually, all credit goes to our brave Hounds! Thanks to their meticulous efforts in gathering the buttons, Miss Sparkle was able to press all of them one by one~
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' Miss Sparkle's certainly worked her finger to the bone... Pressing through a whopping 100,000 buttons, she spent a whole 48 system hours on it!
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 12 Sparkle 01.png|80px|(Crying mask sticker)]]
:'''March 7th:''' ...
:'''Dan Heng:''' ...
:'''Boothill:''' What the fridge is wrong with you???
:'''Argenti:''' Do not be crass, my silver cowboy!
:{Choice} ...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ...
:{Choice} That sure is hard work...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' All the other things you could've done with this level of patience...
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' Your appreciation is received! Of course, it was still down to Miss Sparkle's luck
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' I don't know why, but there were a total of 16,537 esteemed Dreamchasers who volunteered to help Mistress Sparkle bear her burden... Girls who like to smile are always the ones with decent luck~
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' Anyway, the bomb Miss Sparkle placed on the cruise ship is hidden among 999 dolls
:'''From Where to View Fireworks:''' You bright-eyed people will surely find where the real bomb is hidden. Good luck!
:{{DIcon|Warning}} "From Where to View Fireworks" has left the chat
:'''March 7th:''' How many???
:'''Himeko:''' Don't panic. We'll deal with this together
:'''Robin:''' Everyone, please don't make any commotion to cause unnecessary panic
:'''Robin:''' I will arrange for The Family members to prep for evac. But we'll still have to rely on you all to find and defuse the bomb
:'''Robin:''' The Oak Family has always relied on the strength of Order to guarantee everyone that "death never occurs in dreams"
:'''Robin:''' But the blessings of Order are now lost... Its consequences may be unimaginably detrimental
:'''Dan Heng:''' I agree. If anyone finds anything, please update the group promptly.
:'''Argenti:''' The Beauty is duty-bound!
:'''Topaz:''' The IPC will lend our aid too. Don't worry, everyone
:'''Aventurine:''' Wanna bet who will survive this?
