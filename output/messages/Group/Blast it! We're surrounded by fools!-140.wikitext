:'''Mr. Bigwig:''' Woof! That Alarm Clock took the bait! It's going to drink that beverage!
:'''Lady:''' Thankfully I'm good at pretending. You almost let it slip.
:'''Mr. Bigwig:''' I do want to make it mad! I did nothing wrong, woof!
:'''Spade:''' Hey! It's just a rugged piece of metal with a bigger head, and it thinks it's nobler than everyone here. Gah!
:'''Spade:''' Knock it flat! And let's play kick the can!
:'''Siobhan:''' I'll get (Trailblazer) in here.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Siobhan invited you into the group chat.
:'''Mr. Bigwig:''' Come and help us, newbie drinksmith!
:'''Spade:''' Gah! How should we deal with it next!? I... can't wait to start the fun!
:'''Lady:''' How about shoving the stir stick into its spring hole and spinning it hard!? I... I... I'm all fired up!
:{Choice} Great minds think alike.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I've wanted to do this since long ago.
:{Choice} I agree.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I've wanted to do this since long ago.
:'''Lady:''' Ah! Speaking of who can make my heart skip a beat, it's gonna be you!
:'''Melancholy:''' And now the moment for vengeance is at hand, we'll just wait for the curtain to rise...
:'''Siobhan:''' That beverage is on the counter across the room, and I've added some special ingredients to it. Making it drunk for a couple of hours won't be a problem.
:'''Siobhan:''' It's time to teach the disobedient child a lesson.
:'''Siobhan:''' However, this is only its imagined world. Your actions may be hindered, but let's play it by ear.
