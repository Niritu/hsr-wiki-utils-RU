:'''RedBeanStan:''' Hey, I've got some juicy gossip!
:'''RedBeanStan:''' The IPC is sending their guys to the space station!
:{Choice} Go on?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Go on?
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' For real?
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Where are they?
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' They just sneaked in without any notice
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' I've got a hunch that IPC caught wind of the Genius Society big shots having a meeting, and now they're planning to work with them on the Simulated Universe project
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' So... who's coming?
