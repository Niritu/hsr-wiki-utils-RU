:'''Sushang:''' What? Did she say where she was going before she left yesterday?
:'''Guinaifen:''' No, she didn't. Now think about it, something's been off with her since yesterday.
:'''Guinaifen:''' @Huohuo
:'''Sushang:''' @Huohuo
:{Choice} @Huohuo
::'''(Trailblazer):''' @Huohuo
::'''Guinaifen:''' Calling out to her in the group chat won't help. We should contact Hanya right away.
:{Choice} Maybe ask Hanya?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Maybe Hanya can find her.
:'''Guinaifen:''' Let's meet at the usual place
:'''Guinaifen:''' Our ghost-hunting squad can't afford to lose any members!
:'''Guinaifen:''' I've already published a post! Since you're here, let's give it a quick once-over.
:'''Sushang:''' I'll be there soon.
:{Choice} @Huohuo
::'''(Trailblazer):''' @Huohuo
::'''Guinaifen:''' Just stop "@"-ing people and come to Fyxestroll Garden.

:{Choice} I got it
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I asked the person who made the post, and they said we could find the couple in the Aurum Alley.
:'''Sushang:''' Sounds cool. Nothing like the fruitless investigation I'm caught up in.
:'''Sushang:''' I came across a post about an ancient guqin that all of a sudden started playing a mournful melody all on its own. And guess what?
:'''Guinaifen:''' Come on, don't keep me in suspense.
:'''Sushang:''' Turns out it's just an ancient battery-powered guqin. And a nosy someone recently gave it a new battery
:'''Guinaifen:''' Well, that's... typical.
:'''Sushang:''' Looks like (Trailblazer) has found something really strange.
:'''Huohuo:''' @(Trailblazer) I'm coming

:'''Huohuo:''' By the way, Miss Qingque looked so cool~
:'''Guinaifen:''' True dat
:'''Sushang:''' Yeah
:'''Guinaifen:''' Well, let me tell you something funny.
:'''Guinaifen:''' A while back, I got this message from someone accusing me of plagiarizing their shop-review videos. They even threatened to take legal action if I didn't respond right away
:'''Guinaifen:''' I simply replied, "Nah, it's my own stuff from last year."
:'''Guinaifen:''' Then they argued that there's no statute of limitations for plagiarism, and whether I uploaded the video 10 years ago or 100 years ago, it should still count as plagiarism.
:{Choice} What a stroke of bad luck...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're being blackmailed. What a stroke of bad luck...
::'''Guinaifen:''' Bad luck? Hah, I couldn't care less.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Let's not forget that we're internet famous now! We've dealt with all sorts of things.
:{Choice} You're famous now, Little Gui!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That means you're famous now, Little Gui.
::'''Guinaifen:''' That's what I think, too.
:'''Guinaifen:''' Why don't you go check our follower count? I'm feeling like I'm floating on cloud nine now.

:'''Sushang:''' It's like a kind of willpower that can only be cultivated after experiencing countless battles
:'''Guinaifen:''' I don't understand you martial arts guys.
:'''Sushang:''' I'm so tired, Little Gui. Maybe you should talk about account-related stuff
:'''Guinaifen:''' We got lots of different gifts sent by fans

::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why don't you ask Tail first? What does he say?
::'''Huohuo:''' Oh, Mr. Tail says he's not interested.
:'''Guinaifen:''' Well, if Mr. Tail isn't interested, that's fine. We have plenty of other topics to discuss.
