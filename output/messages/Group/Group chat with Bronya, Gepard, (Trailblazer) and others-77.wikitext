:{Choice} Did you have a fight?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Did you have a fight?
:'''Gepard:''' The Supreme Guardian ordered me to garrison in Rivet Town with Silvermane Guards and automatons to stop the IPC's infiltration.
:'''Gepard:''' The defense went smoothly at first, but then Topaz herself appeared with some special technology that allowed her to seize control of all our automatons in an instant.
:'''Gepard:''' It seems Topaz is heading for a certain area in the depths of Rivet Town. For some reason, Svarog is with her too
:'''March 7th:''' Svarog!? Is he trying to go against us again...?
:'''Bronya:''' I hope not. My instinct tells me that there's something else behind this... but I don't know for sure yet
:'''Himeko:''' At least we know where we can find Topaz
:'''Himeko:''' Let's go, March, (Trailblazer).
