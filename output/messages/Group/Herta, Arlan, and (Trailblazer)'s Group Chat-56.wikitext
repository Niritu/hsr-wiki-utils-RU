:'''Herta:''' I see that (Trailblazer)'s coordinates are still at the space station. Maybe it'd be easier to chat in a group
:'''Herta:''' There's a batch of my old manuscripts in the space station. And you know how I've been writing a book for the IPC. So, I've been thinking... maybe how I could just copy and paste a few pages of my old manuscripts for the extra book content
:'''Herta:''' One of them is called decompression equation 36 or something. I can't remember the exact name. Anyway, that's the content. After you clean up the Antimatter Legion, help me find it and send it to the office
:'''Arlan:''' ...Got it
:{Choice} Mission accomplished
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We found it.
::'''Herta:''' Send it over then. Incidentally, I do have an experiment that could use some help from both of you
:{Choice} None of my business
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Not interested. Good luck Arlan
