::'''Phainon:''' Nice. You're all fired up
::'''Dan Heng:''' The room conditions are great, and it's comfortable to rest here. Is there something you want to discuss with us?
:{Choice} The rest wasn't great...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Didn't sleep too well
::'''Phainon:''' That's not good. Is there an issue with the bath's atmosphere?
::'''Dan Heng:''' The room's perfect. I just pushed myself too hard yesterday. Anything you want to discuss?
:{Choice} Oh, it's you...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh, it's you &mdash; I was expecting someone else.
::'''Phainon:''' Who were you expecting? Did someone beat me here?
::'''Dan Heng:''' Nothing. Do you need anything from us?
:'''Phainon:''' I've got some good news!
:'''Phainon:''' Teacher Trianne has located Castrum Kremnos. Hurry to the Chrysos Heirs' Bath in the Marmoreal Palace, and let's get ready to take on Nikador!

:'''Phainon:''' Take it easy
