:{Choice} I just arrived. Still searching.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't worry. We just got to the dock.
:{Choice} I don't see anyone here.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We're there, but we don't see anyone around.
:'''A-Yue:''' Hang on. I just called back and it got through! The location is now at ██████.
:'''A-Yue:''' This place used to be a passenger terminal, but it's been empty since the starskiff line was changed.
:'''A-Yue:''' Something feels off. Anyway, you've got to be careful.
:'''Guinaifen:''' Yeah, you stay safe too. @A-Yue

===Well, turns out this...===

:'''A-Yue:''' Well, turns out this whole thing was just a misunderstanding. I'm really sorry about that...
:'''A-Yue:''' But I never thought I'd ever see my sister again after all these years.
:{Choice} I need more details.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Umm, so what's the full story between you two? Care to tell me more about it?
:{Choice} Can I have some context?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait, hold on. What's happening here? Can you give me some context first?
:'''Guinaifen:''' Same here.
:'''Sushang:''' Same here.
:'''A-Yue:''' My parents were Cloud Knights, but they passed away when we were young.
:'''A-Yue:''' Since I had to support both of us, I had to work all day and didn't have much time to discipline my sister.
:'''A-Yue:''' As a result, she ended up becoming a troublemaker and didn't even finish school.
:'''A-Yue:''' So, I secretly applied for her to join the Cloud Knights, hoping that being in the forces would straighten her out... and maybe she'd become a better person.
:'''A-Yue:''' When she found out what I did, we had a huge argument. She thought I was meddling in her life.
:'''A-Yue:''' I thought she'd refuse to serve and spill the beans to the Military Affairs Office, but... she actually joined the Cloud Knights.
:'''A-Yue:''' After that, we started to drift apart and eventually, one day, she disappeared without a trace.
:{Choice} You did what was best for her.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You did what you thought was best for her. She'll understand it when she grows up. Don't blame yourself over it.
:{Choice} Youths need some tempering.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's good for unruly youngsters to go through some tough experiences to shape them up.
:'''A-Yue:''' I always thought she didn't want to see me because she resented me for enlisting her in the Cloud Knights.
:'''A-Yue:''' But when I saw her today, she told me she got transferred to the Ten-Lords Commission and didn't have the chance to contact me and explain everything.
:'''A-Yue:''' Now that I see she's doing well, I can finally breathe a sigh of relief. As long as she doesn't regret it, I'm okay with it.
:'''A-Yue:''' Anyway, it was a misunderstanding from the start. Sorry for dragging you into my family drama.
:'''A-Yue:''' Go for it, Little Gui! I'll be supporting you!
