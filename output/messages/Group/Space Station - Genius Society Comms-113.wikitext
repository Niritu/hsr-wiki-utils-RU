:'''Asta:''' I heard the helper robot reporting about some recent happenings. If you are going to take group photos, it's best to bring in the person who is directly involved
:'''Screwllum:''' Hm. Ruan Mei got back just in time, too.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Asta has invited (Trailblazer) into group chat
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Hmm
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I just got back from a desolate region to a place with signal
:{Choice} I was just looking for you.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Great. I was looking for you, Madam Ruan Mei
:{Choice} What a chance encounter!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Well, well, look who we have here! I was just thinking about having a chat with Madam Ruan Mei, and lo and behold, I caught up with her!
:'''Ruan Mei:''' What is it?
:{{DIcon|Warning}} The size of the photo you sent is too large. Please compress the file and then try again.
:'''Asta:''' Send it as an attachment. It will be clearer that way
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Attachment "We miss you on the space station" has been sent
:'''Ruan Mei:''' What's this?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Let me have a look...
:'''Ruan Mei:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 11 Ruan Mei 04.png|80px|&lbrack;Please&rbrack;]]
:'''Screwllum:''' I've heard that organic lifeforms are capable of expressing affection in a variety of ways. These creations have exhibited infinite possibilities... Marvelous.
:'''Ruan Mei:''' ...I didn't expect them to develop to such an extent. It's almost like a miniature civilization
:'''Screwllum:''' They are still in their infancy. Calculated per the metrics of organic creatures' lifespans, their society is but in its cradle
:{Choice} Anything you wanna say to them?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is there anything you want to say to them?
:{Choice} Wanna come back and visit them?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So you want to come back and visit them?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' ...
:'''Ruan Mei:''' It's enchanting... This might just be my most beautiful "accident."
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Maybe I will visit the space station soon again
:'''Ruan Mei:''' And visit these little ones
:'''Asta:''' The creations are currently being taken care of by (Trailblazer) and the helper robot. If you need anything, please contact me at any time

:{Choice} [Tea]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 11 Dr. Ratio 01.png|80px|&lbrack;Tea&rbrack;]]
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Mm, most certainly.
