:'''Giovanni:''' Congratulations, (Trailblazer) and Miss March! I heard you beat the championship contender!
:'''Giovanni:''' Now that you have your Mastery Marks, you're qualified to challenge the Overlord Aether Spirits in the Corridor of Fading Echoes.
:'''March 7th:''' Overlord Aether Spirits?
:'''March 7th:''' Sounds pretty tough
:'''Giovanni:''' Yeah, they're more powerful than the average roaming data and can't be acquired in ordinary ways.
:{Choice} Do I need to buy a Premium Pass?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So, do we need to get some sort of "Battle Season Pass" and complete tons of quests to get them?
::'''Giovanni:''' Well, that would be a great way to increase player retention rate, but Aetherium Wars doesn't have that feature.
:{Choice} Do I need to pull them from a gacha?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Do they only appear in a random gacha banner where we need to spend credits to get them?
::'''Giovanni:''' No, no, it's not like that. We don't have a monetization system in Aetherium Wars
::'''Giovanni:''' At least not yet
:{Choice} Do I need to pay for DLCs?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Do we need to pay for an "expansion" or something to access DLC content that actually completes the full game?
::'''Giovanni:''' Haha, no worries. All content in Aetherium Wars is accessible to all players
:'''Giovanni:''' Let me explain. Basically, each Victory Zone has a sealed dimension that only players who have earned their Mastery Marks have access to.
:'''Giovanni:''' The roaming data for the Overlord Aether Spirits are hidden in those dimensions. Defeat them once and you'll get all their data
:'''March 7th:''' Why didn't you tell us earlier!?
:'''March 7th:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 01 March 7th 06.png|80px]]
:'''March 7th:''' We're already on our way back to have a rest
:'''Giovanni:''' My bad. I didn't expect you to get your Mastery Marks so soon.
:'''Giovanni:''' Well, feel free to challenge them in the previous Victory Zone when you have some free time. These powerful Aether Spirits will come in handy in future duels.
