:'''Aglaea:''' To (Trailblazer) and company:<br />Of the Grove's circumstances we are now fully cognizant, and for thy most diligent efforts we harbor the deepest gratitude &mdash; indeed, no words could adequately convey the depth of our appreciation.<br />Alas, the holy city presently faces sundry complications, and manifold duties command our attention, precluding us from extending proper welcome &mdash; for this oversight we express sincere regret.<br />Furthermore, following thy arduous voyage, rest must be prioritized. The particulars of recent events shall be deliberated upon the morrow. So it is written.

:'''Aglaea:''' Very well.
