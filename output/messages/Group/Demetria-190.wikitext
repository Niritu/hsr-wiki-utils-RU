:'''Demetria:''' ...Is that you, (Trailblazer)?
:'''Demetria:''' I didn't mean to intrude, but could you spare a moment to chat with this old soul?
:{Choice} Sure, no problem
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Absolutely, I'm quite the talker
::'''Demetria:''' Thanks, youngster
:{Choice} I'm unavailable right now
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sorry, I'm a bit tied up right now...
::'''Demetria:''' Oh, no worries, you don't have to reply. I can just ramble on to myself...
:'''Demetria:''' I'd like to talk about Possephone and Hadez...
:'''Demetria:''' Back then, I wasn't really in favor of them being together
:'''Demetria:''' Possephone is a simple soul. Treat her well, and she'll do the same for you
:'''Demetria:''' Hadez... I've always thought he was too calculating
:'''Demetria:''' But Possephone liked him, so I respected her choice and wished them the best
:'''Demetria:''' Now, part of me wishes I had been a strict and unyielding bad mom
:'''Demetria:''' ...
:'''Demetria:''' Thanks for your help with the investigation. I'll keep on searching
:'''Demetria:''' Thanks for putting up with my rambling for so long
:'''Demetria:''' Thank you so much for your help, (Trailblazer)
