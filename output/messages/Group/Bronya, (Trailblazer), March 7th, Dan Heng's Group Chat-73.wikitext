:'''Bronya:''' After closing for more than a decade, the cable car station should finally be reopening soon. If you don't mind, I would like you to come to the Overworld for my succession ceremony

:'''Bronya:''' Can you read this message, Express Crew?
:{Choice} Hey, Bronya.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah, I see it
:{Choice} Long time no see!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah, I see it
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It's been a while, Bronya
:'''March 7th:''' Bronya! We're missing you so much!
:'''Bronya:''' Great! I was worried that you couldn't receive messages
:'''Bronya:''' I know you're busy, so I'll keep it short.
:'''Bronya:''' Recently, I've been working on preparing the Solwarm Festival, a traditional Belobogian festival. The standard celebrations for this festival have been suspended for years due to the Fragmentum and the lockdown, and Belobogians now really need a heated celebration to lift their spirits.
:'''Bronya:''' So, if you have time, I'd like to invite you to the Solwarm Festival and witness what we've achieved so far in reviving Belobog
:{Choice} Sure thing!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I will come, for sure!
::'''March 7th:''' Me, too! Festivals and celebrations are right up my alley!
:{Choice} Sorry, maybe next time.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm sorry, but I may not have time for that...
::'''March 7th:''' Come on, @(Trailblazer)! Don't tell me you wanna stay in your room and play on your phone all day long?
::'''March 7th:''' Don't worry. We'll definitely go there! Festivals and celebrations are right up my alley!
:'''Bronya:''' It'd be great if you can come. Everyone has been missing you
:'''Bronya:''' Has @DanHeng been busy these days? He hasn't sent any messages in the group chat
:'''March 7th:''' He's holed up in his room recently. I guess he's turned off all his devices
:'''March 7th:''' We'll check on him for you
:'''Bronya:''' Thank you, March
:'''Bronya:''' I'm looking forward to seeing you all at the Solwarm Festival

:'''Bronya:''' Where are you, March and (Trailblazer)? Are you all right?
:'''March 7th:''' Bronya! We're in the Underworld right now
:'''March 7th:''' The IPC's people took over the Great Mine. We just kicked them out
:'''Bronya:''' I see, you're with Seele
:'''Bronya:''' How are things going? Did you get hurt?
:'''March 7th:''' Don't worry. We can totally handle this!
:{Choice} I failed to persuade Topaz.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm sorry. We weren't able to persuade Topaz...
::'''Bronya:''' No worries, (Trailblazer)! This wasn't your responsibility in the first place
:{Choice} The IPC won't stop there.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm afraid the IPC won't stop there
::'''Bronya:''' I see. Thanks for trying to negotiate with Topaz. This wasn't your responsibility in the first place.
:'''Bronya:''' Something just happened here, and I can't explain it clearly in messages.
:'''Bronya:''' Could you come back to Qlipoth Fort? I need advice from you two on this issue
