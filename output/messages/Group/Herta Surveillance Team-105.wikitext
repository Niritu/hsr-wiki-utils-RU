:{{DIcon|Warning}} You Already Know Me invited Take-Ultimate-To-The-Face to the group chat
:'''You Already Know Me:''' Ok, invited
:'''You Already Know Me:''' Spill
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Looks like we're in for some juicy news
:{Choice} Oh?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Got the deets?
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Don't leak this from the chat
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Ruan Mei's coming to the space station!
:{Choice} ...She's already here.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' ...Isn't she already here?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' You're getting slow with your gossip
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' You really are something
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' But we're still preparing for the welcome ceremony
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Ruan Mei doesn't appreciate it
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' I heard she's a loner even among the geniuses
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' So all our work was for nothing?
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Why didn't you give a heads-up ahead of time
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' Herta's also turned a blind eye to what she does
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' That's the "big shot" special treatment
:{Choice} It's okay
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's okay. Other big shots will show up sooner or later
::'''Bill Portcullis:''' Hmm, I'll be waiting then
:{Choice} Stop working hard
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is what you get when you work hard
::'''Bill Portcullis:''' You seem pretty enlightened
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Apparently Miss Ruan Mei's personality isn't all that great
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Word? Is there ever a genius who's normal?
:'''M-Robot:''' Screwllum seems pretty chill
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Ok fine, I'll give you that

:{{DIcon|Warning}} Rich_Knowit invited Peoplebreaker to the group chat
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Welcome, new friend
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' [[undefined|80px]]
:'''You Already Know Me:''' What an honor to see you here
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 02.png|80px]]
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Looks like my importance in this chat is now downgraded by 1.
:'''M-Robot:''' Looks like my importance in this chat is now downgraded by 1.
:{Choice} This chat feels like déjà vu
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why do I have the feeling that I've seen this chat before?
::'''You Already Know Me:''' Fr
:{Choice} The ID here looks familiar
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Say... Your ID Rich_Knowit seems familiar... Are you perhaps related to Richard_Knowitall?
::'''Rich_Knowit:''' ...So you knew of the handle I used before that account got nuked. Looks like you're chronically online.
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' Ok ok, let's get back to the topic. How do we deal with the situation?
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Accountability! Accountability must be held!
:{Choice} What's wrong?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What's all the fuss about?
:{Choice} What accountability?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What accountability?
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' So you still don't know?
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' {{tx|Video missing}}
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Just look at this! They are walking all over us! Positively assaulting Madam Herta at this rate!
:'''M-Robot:''' Yeah, right. And the management of this space station is for real so crappy.
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' The Legion incident aside, how could they allow Madam Herta to be attacked on our own turf?
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' J&mdash;Just what is going on!?
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' *sighs* I really hate these imbecilic pests who sit in high places and do nothing.
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' But when all is said and done, after the Legion crisis, the space station has done a good job in revitalizing and rebuilding.
:'''M-Robot:''' You got a point.
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Those are two different kettles of fish. Besides, they were never that competent to begin with?
:{Choice} That's more like it
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's more like it!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But isn't the main focus here Herta's safety?
:{Choice} Aren't you jumping ahead
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Aren't you jumping ahead...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Isn't the main focus Herta's safety?
:{Choice} You're right!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're right!
::'''You Already Know Me:''' You think so too? Huh, interesting. Let's have a chat later... PRIVATELY
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No need... Isn't the main focus Herta's safety?
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Let's not poke our noses into other people's business. Isn't that Asta's job?
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Our job is to sit here and judge the quality of their work. As for HOW to get things done, that's for them to worry about!
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' You sure have some bizarre reasoning, but you're spitting facts here.
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' You're absolutely right bro! Rich_Knowit, you spoke my mind!
:{Choice} ...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' ...
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Comrades, what is our goal?
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' To rid ourselves of all imbecilic pests!
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Good. You passed

:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' ?
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' ?
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' What on earth is this?
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' "The missing researchers are all opinion leaders on the space station's Dark Web..."
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Holy moly, you know stuff that even the Security Department isn't aware of.
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Ahem, I just got the file from next door.
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' It sounds far-fetched, but on the off chance that it's true...
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' I smell a conspiracy.
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' They staged the whole missing thing to get rid of dissenters.
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' Tsk, tsk, that's such a brilliant plot. Justice may come late, but it will be served. The management must step down!
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' The management must step down!
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' If that's really the case, doesn't it mean this chat group is in grave danger?
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' ...
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' ...
:'''Rich_Knowit:''' ?

===Have you heard===

:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Have you heard
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' Hmm
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' Lead Research Asta was attacked too.
:'''M-Robot:''' That Duke Inferno
:'''M-Robot:''' Devious! Conniving!
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' Psyops on the masses have always been the most terrifying kind of attack
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Indeed. It seems that the Annihilation Gang isn't just about mindless violence, as the rumors suggest.
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' If the Lead Researcher wasn't rescued at the end, we'd all be in deep, deep trouble
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' Not necessarily. Maybe she's the one who orchestrated it all
:'''Licenseless Space Driving:''' Masterminding this elaborate ruse by deliberately harming herself to earn some sympathy points
:'''M-Robot:''' That line of thought does have some merit...
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' Enough already. This is ridiculous.
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' Is that really worth it? All that hassle just to palliate a few keyboard warriors?
:'''M-Robot:''' True Dat!
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Speaking of which, where's that very first rabble-rouser, Rich_Knowit
:'''Peoplebreaker:''' Oh, right. He was real righteous sounding when he invited me into the group
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Let me see
:'''Bill Portcullis:''' Ugh, the guy left the group without making any noise...
