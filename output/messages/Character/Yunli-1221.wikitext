:'''Yunli:''' Have you seen March 7th? She didn't turn up for practice
:{Choice} Why don't you just message her?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Did you send her any messages? I haven't seen her either
::'''Yunli:''' She's not replying to my messages
:{Choice} I plan to go look for her...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I was just planning to look for her. Frankly, I haven't seen her around either
::'''Yunli:''' Oh
:{Choice} Who's March 7th?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' March 7th? We never had anyone named March 7th here
::'''Yunli:''' Helping her skip class, eh? Your friendship must be pretty solid. How about you take her spot for this training session?
::'''Yunli:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 16 Yunli 04.png|80px|&lbrack;Image&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No thanks! I haven't seen her
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|&lbrack;Image&rbrack;]]
:'''Yunli:''' Hm. If I can't find March 7th, then I can only seek out her legal guardian
:'''Yunli:''' Which is you
:{Choice} I'm not her legal guardian
::'''(Trailblazer):''' First off: I'm definitely not March's legal guardian
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You can go look for Mr. Yang or Miss Himeko. If they're not there, you can find Dan Heng
::'''Yunli:''' Too many names. Can't remember
:{Choice} No use talking to her guardians
::'''(Trailblazer):''' If the kid won't perform, seeking the grown-ups out won't do anything either
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Besides, when has March ever listened to me
::'''Yunli:''' Indeed. Grandpa would usually throw out all the complainers...
:'''Yunli:''' Agh. I was ordered to instruct her in the ways of the sword
:'''Yunli:''' She can skip this class, but I can't skip my duty
:'''Yunli:''' We need to talk about your child's behavior, (Trailblazer)
:'''Yunli:''' How about this &mdash; you come find me at Aurum Alley
:'''Yunli:''' I'll wait for you

===Grandpa says that the...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Yunli:''' Grandpa says that the Astral Express has been everywhere
:'''Yunli:''' Have you seen anyone weird recently?
:'''Yunli:''' If someone looks weird, they could be in possession of a cursed sword
:{Choice} I'm weird
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm weird. What do you want?
::'''Yunli:''' ?
::'''Yunli:''' I think you're perfectly fine
::'''Yunli:''' I'm quite good at judging people
:{Choice} Haven't met anyone like that
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Nope, everyone looks normal to me
::'''Yunli:''' Is there a possibility that you're the weird one?
::'''Yunli:''' Just kidding
::'''Yunli:''' I know you don't have a cursed sword
::'''Yunli:''' I'm quite good at judging people
:{Choice} I know plenty
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What type of weird are you talking about? I know plenty of weird people. Lemme grab one for you to have a chat
::'''Yunli:''' ...
::'''Yunli:''' Feel like you misunderstood me
:'''Yunli:''' Anyways, I'm just asking around
:'''Yunli:''' It'll be quicker to just ask you lot about the whereabouts of the cursed swords
:{Choice} Is it urgent?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Is it urgent?
:'''Yunli:''' Urgent
:'''Yunli:''' Super urgent
:'''Yunli:''' There are a total of 1382 cursed swords forged by Hanguang
:'''Yunli:''' I've only melted a little more than 300 of them!
:'''Yunli:''' The cursed swords are bloodthirsty and love to kill. If you wield it, you'll become its puppet and turn into a puppet that only knows killing
:'''Yunli:''' Any moment I don't act, the world would see more wronged souls and bloodshed
:'''Yunli:''' I promised grandpa to wait a while, but I think I've waited long enough
:{Choice} What's your grandpa's response?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You said you've waited long enough. What's your grandpa's response to that?
::'''Yunli:''' That's not important
::'''Yunli:''' What's important is... I want to hunt! Down! All! Cursed! Swords!
:{Choice} Don't give yourself too much pressure
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't give yourself too much pressure
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're still young
::'''Yunli:''' Yeah. How can I possibly let myself sleep easy at this age?
:'''Yunli:''' Anyways
:'''Yunli:''' You guys have seen a lot, if you do see any of these swords, please tell me
:'''Yunli:''' I will not let a single cursed sword escape

===(Trailblazer), are you there?===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Yunli:''' (Trailblazer), are you there?
:'''Yunli:''' I'd like to talk to you for a bit
:'''Yunli:''' So, your sword
:{Choice} It's a ball bat
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It's a ball bat
:'''Yunli:''' Your bat sword
:'''Yunli:''' Seems to be always saying strange things
:'''Yunli:''' It's not like something that a sword might say
:{Choice} Because it's a bat
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Because it's a bat, not a sword
::'''Yunli:''' Grandpa says that swords have no fixed shape
:{Choice} Can you really hear swords speak?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Can you really hear swords speak?
::'''Yunli:''' That's a natural feeling
::'''Yunli:''' Swords speak truer than humans
:'''Yunli:''' But I can't quite see through your sword
:'''Yunli:''' Its vibe is pretty sharp and straightforward
:'''Yunli:''' But it seems somewhat contradictory at the same time
:'''Yunli:''' Its contradiction is filled with joy
:'''Yunli:''' Yet that joy seems to have a tinge of bitterness to it
:{Choice} Just lay it on me
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Just lay it on me straight, master. What's wrong with my baby?
:'''Yunli:''' Nothing's wrong
:'''Yunli:''' You've taught it well
:'''Yunli:''' But...
:'''Yunli:''' Its emotions are quite elusive
:'''Yunli:''' "It's mid!"
:'''Yunli:''' "So peak!"
:'''Yunli:''' "S-tier!"
:'''Yunli:''' "F-tier!"
:{Choice} [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px]]
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px]]
:'''Yunli:''' All of the above are words said by your bat sword
:'''Yunli:''' That's why I want to interact with it more
:'''Yunli:''' The more I think about it, the more urgent it feels
:'''Yunli:''' I think I shall come and look for you right this moment
:'''Yunli:''' See you later

===I have gossip. Do...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Yunli:''' I have gossip. Do you wanna hear it?
:'''Yunli:''' There are people using delicious food to tempt a master into teaching them martial arts
:'''Yunli:''' Wait
:'''Yunli:''' There's a twist
:{Choice} I didn't even agree to listen
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I didn't even agree to listen
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What live gossip is this?
:'''Yunli:''' I'm currently eavesdropping on two swords whispering at each other
:'''Yunli:''' But they are being pretty loud
:'''Yunli:''' So, I don't think I'm eavesdropping
:'''Yunli:''' The broadsword is saying that its master is a silly boy who can't do anything right
:'''Yunli:''' The short sword is saying that its master is a witty girl who has amazing culinary skills
:'''Yunli:''' Not long ago, the girl accompanied the silly boy on an adventure. They met a master swordsman and wanted to learn from him, but the master refused to teach them anything.
:'''Yunli:''' Unless they make him gourmet food for 10 days straight, with a different dish every day
:{Choice} Go on.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' So? Did they succeed?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I mean, did they succeed in learning anything?
:'''Yunli:''' I'm still listening to their conversation
:'''Yunli:''' They are saying that the two teamed up and served the master Beggar's Chicken
:'''Yunli:''' Oh, and they made steamed tofu
:'''Yunli:''' Stir-fried duck feet
:'''Yunli:''' Chicken tongue soup
:'''Yunli:''' Yuanyang pan-fried beef tendon
:'''Yunli:''' Lotus ham dumplings
:'''Yunli:''' Stuffed egg rolls
:'''Yunli:''' Pig's brain soup
:'''Yunli:''' My tummy is growling
:'''Yunli:''' I'm going to buy some snacks, then I'll be back to listen to the story
:'''Yunli:''' ...No, not a story. It's the thoughts of these swords
:{Choice} Buy some for me too!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm getting hungry too! Buy some for me as well!
:'''Yunli:''' No problem
