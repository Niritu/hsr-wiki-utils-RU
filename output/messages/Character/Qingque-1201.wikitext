===Hey there. I heard...===

:'''Qingque:''' Hey there. I heard folks from the Artisanship Commission say that you helped clear the Ambrosial Arbor coils. You're indeed as saintly as the general says you are
:{Choice} It doesn't sound like a compliment to me.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Saintly? That doesn't sound much like a compliment
::'''Qingque:''' Of course it's a compliment. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Only when busy people get busy do slackers get a chance to slack off
::'''Qingque:''' But, based on your past experience, won't you get a sort of a hunch when I message flatteries to you?
::'''Qingque:''' ...A hunch? Like, this person wants something from me?
::{Choice} What do you want from me?
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' So, what do you want from me?
::{Choice} Can I pretend not to know?
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' How about this? You recall the message now, and we forget about the whole thing
:::'''Qingque:''' No!
:{Choice} Sounds like you need a favor
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't beat around the bush. What's the matter?
::'''Qingque:''' It seems that you are already used to the pleasantries people use on Xianzhou, and know when the work will come.<br />You will go far, young {{MC|f=lady|m=man}}! I believe you will soon understand my three basic principles for happiness at work
::'''Qingque:''' But the trouble comes from me this time. Please don't shrug it off and do help me
:{Choice} That's me alright!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I am brave and kind, and I love to help others.
::'''Qingque:''' Great! A brave and kind person like you can definitely help me
:'''Qingque:''' Do you remember the craftsman apprentice named Chengjie from the Artisanship Commission?
:{Choice} I don't remember
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't remember
::'''Qingque:''' It's okay if you don't remember. Come to the Artisanship Commission. I'll show him to you
:{Choice} I kind of remember
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Chengjie, the apprentice... I think I remember him
::'''Qingque:''' Then that's easy
:'''Qingque:''' I was sent here by the master diviner to assist the Artisanship Commission in assessing the damages
:'''Qingque:''' Everything was going well, but now the situation with Chengjie is getting beyond my scope of work...
:'''Qingque:''' Can you come over to find me? I am at the Artisanship Commission's port

:'''Qingque:''' Hey, I'm gonna cut to the chase
:'''Qingque:''' Have you heard from Chengjie lately?
:{Choice} Who's Chengjie?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Who's Chengjie again?
::'''Qingque:''' Wow, you sure forget things fast
::'''Qingque:''' Lemme show you some keywords to jog your memory
::'''Qingque:''' The master's dream
::'''Qingque:''' Artisanship Commission apprentice
::'''Qingque:''' The person who only worked on his dream for three days
::{Choice} I don't know him
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sorry, I don't know him
:::'''Qingque:''' You either only have seven seconds of memory, or you haven't talked to him for too long, or your enthusiasm was hurt by his laziness...
::{Choice} We haven't talked for a while
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I remember him now. But we haven't talked for a while
:{Choice} We haven't talked for a while
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We haven't talked for a while
:{Choice} He told me to wait for updates
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Chengjie told me to wait for news, but he never sent anything
:'''Qingque:''' I'm not a close friend of his, but since he's my game mate, I'm still quite worried whether his mental state is...
:'''Qingque:''' Is fit to play with me in the future
:'''Qingque:''' So, let's go check up on him. I'll see you at the Artisanship Commission

===Is everything all right...===

:'''(Trailblazer):''' Is everything all right on your end?
:{Choice} Don't go to the Divination Commission
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Stay away from the Divination Commission for now. It could be dangerous there.
:'''Qingque:''' ?
:'''Qingque:''' Don't worry. I just saw what happened and posted about it as soon as I took a left turn out the door.
:'''Qingque:''' So, what exactly has happened? Why is everyone looking so sluggish?
:{Choice} Guard the gate.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Guard the gate, Qingque. Don't let anyone in or out of the Divination Commission.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Stay safe. We'll be right there!
:'''Qingque:''' Got it. Now I'm a real door guardian.

===It looks just like you===

:{Choice} (Send the picture to Qingque)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It looks just like you
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Message Qingque 35.png|256px]]
:'''Qingque:''' Can it play Celestial Jade?
:{Choice} Probably not. Look at its hands...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't think so. Look at its paws. I don't think it can hold tiles
::'''Qingque:''' True
:{Choice} I'm not sure about this.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Has Celestial Jade ever been popular on the space station? I think they probably don't know how to play. I'm not really sure about the specifics.
::'''Qingque:''' A pity. A life without Celestial Jade is a life lived incomplete
::'''Qingque:''' *sigh* With so many people, it would be easy to set up matches. A shame
:'''Qingque:''' Remember to ask if it has any interest in Celestial Jade
:'''Qingque:''' If the answer is yes, then come to the Luofu and we can be game-buddies

:{Choice} You've lost everything so quickly?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You've lost everything in such a short amount of time?
::'''Qingque:''' Not really... But my current situation is worse!
:'''Qingque:''' Argh! I blame my greed
:'''Qingque:''' I should have been more careful
:'''Qingque:''' Anyway, (Trailblazer), come save me! I don't have any other friends here apart from you, my bestie.
:{Choice} Where are you?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Where are you?
:'''Qingque:''' I'm at... Where's this place again?
:'''Qingque:''' Oh, I heard them saying that this is the hotel in the Dreamscape.
:'''Qingque:''' Hurry! Otherwise I might really be a goner.

{{Messages|text=
:'''Qingque:''' Hey have you registered for the new immersia that just came out
:'''Qingque:''' Come be my buddy
:{Choice} Buddy?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Buddy?
::'''Qingque:''' Oh, I call those who play games of Celestial Jade with us buddies
::'''Qingque:''' But I was talking about the new foxian immersia called Viridian Soul, we call those buddies too
:{Choice} Immersia?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Immersia?
::'''Qingque:''' Oh it's just a foxian sympathetic immersia called Viridian Soul
::'''Qingque:''' Specifically for playing Celestial Jade, so we call them buddies
:'''Qingque:''' Long as you have a jade abacus you can join in too, it's very easy
:{Choice} Basically a mobile game
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Ah got it, it's basically a mobile game
:'''Qingque:''' ? What's a mobile game? I don't understand
:'''Qingque:''' Anyway, I've already registered, it's free
:'''Qingque:''' Now I can play it at work
:'''Qingque:''' You coming? I'll open up a friend room for us
:{Choice} I don't know how to play
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'd like to
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But I don't know how to play Celestial Jade
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|&lbrack;cry&rbrack;]]

::'''Qingque:''' Come over to the games parlor when you have time, you'll pick it up in no time

::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
::'''Qingque:''' Working is tiring, okay
::'''Qingque:''' It really releases stress, just try it
:{Choice} Really?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Really?
:'''Qingque:''' I'm not lying
:'''Qingque:''' With the number of people on the Express, it should be easy to find enough players
:'''Qingque:''' You can teach everyone after learning it, then you'll be able to play together

===Oh right, I wanna...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Qingque:''' Oh right, I wanna ask for a favor
:'''Qingque:''' I went to listen to Mr. Xiyan's storytelling after work, but he stopped at a cliffhanger, I can't take it
:'''Qingque:''' He's resuming tomorrow, but at an earlier time
:'''Qingque:''' I don't know if I'll be able to get there soon enough after work
:'''Qingque:''' If I can't make it, can you go and listen in my stead?
:{Choice} No problem
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sure
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But I haven't heard the story today, would I be able to understand anything tomorrow?
:{Choice} No time
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm a little busy tomorrow
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|&lbrack;cry&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' And I haven't heard the story today, it's likely I wouldn't be able to understand anything tomorrow
:'''Qingque:''' Oh the story today is about the Cloudstrider, and apparently THEY have a train
:'''Qingque:''' This train is like the Xianzhou ships and can travel between worlds
:{Choice} It does sound familiar
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Why does that sound familiar...
:'''Qingque:''' Right?
:'''Qingque:''' That's why I'm asking for a favor
:'''Qingque:''' Mr. Xiyan said the Cloudstrider once arrived at a planet called Harilo
:'''Qingque:''' But was sucked into a huge conspiracy and even battled a massive aurumaton
:'''Qingque:''' Don't spoil whatever happens next to me, just tell me what Mr. Xiyan's version is tomorrow
:{Choice} Where is Harilo?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Where is Harilo?
:{Choice} What is this massive aurumaton?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What is this massive aurumaton?
:'''Qingque:''' ...
:'''Qingque:''' So you don't know?
:'''Qingque:''' Alright, looks like I still have to be there in person tomorrow to get the story
:{Choice} I'll tell you my story next time
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll tell you my story next time
:'''Qingque:''' Okay!!!
