:{Choice} No
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No, I am Pom-Pom
::'''March 7th:''' Yeah, you totally look like Pom-Pom. Alright, stop kidding around. There's something important
:{Choice} What's up?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm here. What's up?
:'''March 7th:''' I suddenly remember there was one thing that caught my attention during this trip to the Luofu
:'''March 7th:''' That Matrix of Prescience Ultima at the Divination Commission
:'''March 7th:''' The master diviner used that thing to interrogate Kafka, and saw right into her memories without Kafka even saying a word
:'''March 7th:''' So I was thinking... Could this matrix be used on me?
:{Choice} You didn't mention this earlier?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why didn't you ask her at the Seat of Divine Foresight?
:{Choice} It's worth asking her...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's worth asking. We might even be able to find your lost memories
::'''March 7th:''' Yes, yes! I wanted to ask at the Seat of Divine Foresight, but after thinking about it, I felt a little uneasy
:'''March 7th:''' The Luofu had just experienced a huge incident. Jing Yuan is injured, and the master diviner needs to manage the whole place
:'''March 7th:''' I couldn't bring up this personal matter
:'''March 7th:''' So I thought I'd wait till she wasn't so busy, and then we could go to the Divination Commission together to ask her?
:{Choice} No problem
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No problem. Let's meet at the Divination Commission
::'''March 7th:''' I knew it! You're the best!
:{Choice} Do I have to go too?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Do I have to go too? It's not that I don't wanna, but this is your personal affair...
::'''March 7th:''' I... I... I'm just embarrassed to ask others for help on my own! See you at the Divination Commission

:'''March 7th:''' (Trailblazer), do you remember why we came to the Luofu this time?
:{Choice} Witness you as sword master!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Of course I do! To witness you becoming the Express' greatest sword master!
::'''March 7th:''' That was important, too! But that was not our original reason, was it?
:{Choice} For the Wardance, right?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We came to take part in the Wardance, didn't we?
::'''March 7th:''' That's right! If I hadn't asked, you'd have forgotten!
:'''March 7th:''' We originally came as VIP guests to take part in the Wardance! Then, as expected, we ran into accidents!
:'''March 7th:''' We successfully captured Hoolay on the Skysplitter and General Jing Yuan decided to formally hold the Wardance for real
:'''March 7th:''' I have two Masters that got me nice benefits, so I've managed to get two staff passes for you and Dan Heng. You can come straight to the Skysplitter backstage without any trouble!
:'''March 7th:''' I'm amazing, right? Where is my praise?
:{Choice} Thank you, Super-March!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Thank you, Super-March! I knew I could count on you!
::'''March 7th:''' You're the best! Dan Heng was so frosty. All he said was something about: "One should maintain a proper distance from contestants when spectating sports..." Such a buzz kill~
:{Choice} What's so good about backstage?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What's so good about going backstage? I feel like spectators should keep their distance from competitors
::'''March 7th:''' That's weird. That's pretty much what Dan Heng said... But you'll be able to see all kinds of things backstage that you won't see anywhere else! You know the Xianzhou saying: "A minute on stage is ten years of hard work offstage!"
::'''March 7th:''' Forget it. I don't care if you two come or not! Humph!
:'''March 7th:''' I'm going back to training. Chat later!
