===(Trailblazer), it's been a while!===

:'''Arlan:''' (Trailblazer), it's been a while!
:'''Arlan:''' Recently, a videotape was reported to have been stolen, but the elderly researcher from the Department of Insight, who is in charge of it, is a bit... stubborn. She insists that the footage contains sensitive material and refuses to let the Security Department get involved to conduct any investigation
:'''Arlan:''' You left a good impression on the old heads of the department and have quite a positive reputation among the elderly here. If you go to investigate, I'm sure the seniors will cooperate
:{Choice} Sure. Caring for the elderly and the young is my passion
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sure. Caring for the elderly and the young is my passion
:{Choice} How did I ever become the go-to {{MC|m=guy|f=gal}} for the elderly...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How did I ever become the go-to {{MC|m=guy|f=gal}} for the elderly...
:'''Arlan:''' Nice. I knew I could count on you. The old lady's name is Esther. You can find her in the master control zone. I'm right now busy taming this Wubbaboo at the moment. So, talk to you later!
:{Choice} The first sentence... Are you being sarcastic?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' The first sentence... Are you being sarcastic?
:{Choice} I won't go until you reply
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I won't go until you reply
:{Choice} When will you reply!?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' When will you reply!?
:{Choice} I'll get mad if you don't reply

===Thanks for your help...===
{{Messages

:'''Arlan:''' Thanks for your help in uncovering the conspirator, I would like to thank you on behalf of Asta. Leave the rest to me
:{Choice} Herta didn't punish Asta, did she?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Herta didn't punish Asta, did she?
::'''Arlan:''' You really don't understand Madam Herta, do you? She couldn't care less about trivial matters like this
:{Choice} Is it true that Asta bought all those things with her own money?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is it true that Asta bought all those things with her own money?
::'''Arlan:''' So you really don't know...
:'''Arlan:''' This space station may be Madam Herta's property, but she didn't pay a single credit for its construction
:'''Arlan:''' Miss Asta's family has ties to the IPC, so saying she's... "wealthy" would be an understatement. Most of the facilities in the space station were essentially funded by her...
:'''Arlan:''' So the cost of those things she purchased... was practically nothing for her, really
:{Choice} What exactly is the Interastral Peace Corporation?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What exactly is the Interastral Peace Corporation?
::'''Arlan:''' Ahh... You can just think of them as the cosmos's wealthiest organization
:{Choice} Is it too late to cozy up with Miss Asta now?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is it too late to cozy up with Miss Asta now?
::'''Arlan:''' ...Please don't joke about that. I'll take it seriously
::'''Arlan:''' [[undefined|80px|...]]
:{Choice} Have you decided on what to do with Richard?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Have you decided on what to do with Richard?
::'''Arlan:''' ...I don't think you want to know the details
:'''Arlan:''' In any case, I have to thank you for helping Miss Asta with this incident

:'''Arlan:''' Do you have some time? I still haven't thanked you for helping me when we first met
:{Choice} First met... When was that?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' First met... What do you mean?
::'''Arlan:''' You found me wounded in the monitoring room and took me somewhere safe
::'''Arlan:''' Thank you... If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have lasted much longer
:{Choice} You're being too polite
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're being too polite. It was nothing
::'''Arlan:''' I wouldn't have lasted much longer if you hadn't found me
::'''Arlan:''' Thank you for finding me in the monitoring room and taking me somewhere safe
:{Choice} Shouldn't you be thanking Dan Heng?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You should thank Dan Heng. He was the one who found you
::'''Arlan:''' Both of you saved my life. I wouldn't have lasted much longer
::'''Arlan:''' Thank you for finding me and taking me somewhere safe
:'''Arlan:''' Do you have time to come to the base zone? I have a gift I want to give you
:{Choice} I'll be right over
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sure. I'll be right over
:{Choice} You're being too polite
::'''(Trailblazer):''' A gift? Now I feel awkward
::'''Arlan:''' Don't worry. It's not anything expensive
:{Choice} Can you mail it?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Can you mail it to me?
::'''Arlan:''' I want to give it to you face-to-face. That's more formal
:'''Arlan:''' I'll wait for you

:{Choice} Nope
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm not there at the moment. What's the matter? Did something happen?
:{Choice} Just got back
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're really impressive as the head of the Security Department. I've just got back, and you already know about this stuff.
:'''Arlan:''' I need a favor from you. There are a lot of critters at the space station.
:'''Arlan:''' Um, it's too complicated to explain over text. Let's meet up.

:'''Arlan:''' (Trailblazer), you've got my respect.
:'''Arlan:''' A guy from the Maintenance Department just told me the terminal nearly went kaput. The data collected has reached the threshold, according to the researchers from the Department of Ecology.
:'''Arlan:''' I feel so bad for always troubling you with the space station's issues
:{Choice} No worries, Arlan!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We're good buddies. There's no need to stand on ceremony with me. Don't you think so, Arlan?
::'''Arlan:''' We're close, and that's all the more reason that I feel bad for bothering you with my problems...
:{Choice} I'm glad to help.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' In a sense, the space station is my second home. I'm glad to help, and you're welcome.
::'''Arlan:''' I'm so lucky to be your friend. Kind people like you are a rare find.
:'''Arlan:''' I really appreciate what you did. If there's a chance, I hope I'll be able to help you with something too.

{{Messages|text=
:'''Arlan:''' (Trailblazer), which color do you think suits me better, blue or gray?
:'''Arlan:''' As a friend, please choose based on your first impression!
:{Choice} Blue

::'''Arlan:''' Hehe, I knew blue suits me
::'''Arlan:''' It seems we have the same fashion sense!
:{Choice} Gray

:{Choice} Are you hacked?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Send me a selfie to prove that you are not hacked. You are a bit abnormal
