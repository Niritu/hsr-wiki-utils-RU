:'''Seele:''' A bunch of rascals came down to the Underworld and took over the Great Mine by force
:'''Seele:''' I asked Bronya what to do, and she told me not to mess with them for the time being
:{Choice} Listen to her, and don't mess with them.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Bronya was right. It's probably best not to mess with them
::'''Seele:''' Too late. Wildfire and Silvermane Guards already engaged with them
:{Choice} We must fight back.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We can't let those guys bully the miners! We must fight back
::'''Seele:''' Yeah, we're already on it. Wildfire and Silvermane Guards already engaged with them.
:'''Seele:''' But those jerks have super advanced fancy weapons with jacked up damage. We can't handle them

:'''Seele:''' So have they made up or are they still fighting?
:{Choice} They've reconciled
::'''(Trailblazer):''' They've reconciled
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Just some things they can't say in person
::'''Seele:''' Why
::'''Seele:''' Wouldn't it be better to tell each other in person?
:{Choice} Still fighting
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Still fighting
::'''(Trailblazer):''' They must be fighting through text

::'''Seele:''' Might as well fight again in person

:{Choice} I don't know
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't know
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Every situation is different

::'''(Trailblazer):''' I like doing sports
::'''Seele:''' Sports? Why don't you come over to Wildfire and be a runner?
::'''Seele:''' I guarantee you'll get your step count in no time
:'''Seele:''' How bothersome... Now that I have time, I don't know what to spend my time on

:{Choice} What a serene hobby...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What a serene hobby...
::'''Seele:''' Why, don't trust me?
:{Choice} It doesn't sound like you...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It doesn't sound like you...

===Are you there? I...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Seele:''' Are you there? I have a question
:'''Seele:''' Normally
:'''Seele:''' do you read?
:{Choice} Never
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Never
::'''Seele:''' Is that so?
::'''Seele:''' I guess we are similar in that way
:{Choice} I sometimes read web novels from other planets
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I sometimes read web novels from other planets
::'''Seele:''' Web novels? Are they interesting?
::'''Seele:''' *sigh* I don't like reading
:{Choice} I read everything
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I read everything
::'''Seele:''' That's impressive
::'''Seele:''' *sigh* I don't like reading
:'''Seele:''' Reading is tiring and uses my brain power
:'''Seele:''' The moment I start reading a new page, I'd already forgotten what the previous page was about
:'''Seele:''' I don't know how Bronya manages to read so much
:{Choice} She's been educated to do so since she was young
::'''(Trailblazer):''' She's been educated to do so since she was young
::'''Seele:''' Hmph, ikr?
::'''Seele:''' So it's normal that I can't read much, right?
:{Choice} The first step is always the hardest
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The first step is always the hardest
::'''Seele:''' It's very difficult
::'''Seele:''' When I was young, I was just trying to survive on the streets, how would I have the time to read
:'''Seele:''' Gah, Bronya gave me a huge list of book recommendations
:'''Seele:''' I tried a few of them and only managed to get through the first few pages
:'''Seele:''' I can't read them without getting drowsy
:'''Seele:''' Oh, but there's a book that's pretty interesting
:'''Seele:''' ''Tale of the Winterlands'', I only managed to read a few pages, but it's pretty gripping
:'''Seele:''' That's all, just wanted to vent a bit
:'''Seele:''' I'll go ahead and keep reading. I'll try my best to finish the book
