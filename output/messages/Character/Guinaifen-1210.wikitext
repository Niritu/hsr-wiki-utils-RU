:'''Guinaifen:''' Hey, do you have time right now? Can we meet up at Fyxestroll Garden?
:{Choice} Are you all right?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What are you planning to do at Fyxestroll Garden? By the way, are you feeling better now?
::'''Guinaifen:''' Aw, thanks for the concern! People like me, who have to hustle all day out there under the sun, are all pretty tough...
::'''Guinaifen:''' The healers in the Alchemy Commission have looked me over. Besides a bit of shock and some bruises, I'm totally fine!
:{Choice} Are you the real Guinaifen?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Isn't Guinaifen supposed to be at the apothecary right now? Don't think you can fool me again, you little heliobus!
::'''Guinaifen:''' Come on, can't we have some trust between us?
::'''Guinaifen:''' The healers in the Alchemy Commission have looked me over. Besides a bit of shock and some bruises, I'm totally fine!
:{Choice} Fyxestroll Garden again?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Didn't you cause a lot of trouble last time at Fyxestroll Garden?
::'''Guinaifen:''' I'm terribly sorry for the trouble I caused last time.
::'''Guinaifen:''' But I really need your help this time.
:'''Guinaifen:''' Actually, Hanya personally invited us for a meeting.
:'''Guinaifen:''' Well, why don't you just come to Fyxestroll Garden so we can talk in person? Texting is too much of a hassle.

:'''Guinaifen:''' [[File:Message Guinaifen Crepescule.png|256px]]
:'''Guinaifen:''' For more deets about ghosts on the Xianzhou, please like and follow Little Gui for more awesome content
:{Choice} How do I watch this exactly?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yes yes yes! So pray tell where can I see it?
:{Choice} What's this? Who are you?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why are there more people promoting strange advertisements in my messages?
:{Choice} I doubt there are any ghosts
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's definitely another hocus-pocus stream that ends up with magnetic distortions or some magic trick being the reason behind shenanigans
::'''Guinaifen:''' FR, I ain't lying
:'''Guinaifen:''' Ha! It sounds like you're interested, fam.
:'''Guinaifen:''' I haven't edited the stream recording yet, so I won't send the link
:'''Guinaifen:''' How about this? If you're really interested, then come find me!
:{Choice} Very interested
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm very interested. Don't go anywhere, I'm coming to find you.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Alright, hurry it up. I'm in dire need of someone like you who's burning with curiosity!
:{Choice} Not interested
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Actually, I'm not interested
::'''Guinaifen:''' Are you sure, fam?
::'''Guinaifen:''' Reach deep inside and give your honest answer to me~ After all, you're the only one who replied to my mass message...
::'''Guinaifen:''' How about this? I can show you the raw footage of my ghost live stream fresh from the oven!
:{Choice} New scam, right?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Heh, probably a new scam
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Fool someone into heading over, then get them to pay or do chores because they're there already.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Agh, fine, how about this. I can show you the raw footage of my ghost live stream fresh from the oven!
:'''Guinaifen:''' I'm here at Aurum Alley. If you see a red-haired traveler, that's me!

:{Choice} (Send the picture to Guinaifen)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Holy! I encountered a little lifeform that looks just like you
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Message Guinaifen 31.png|256px]]
:'''Guinaifen:''' So true!
:'''Guinaifen:''' Where did you get such a cute little thing
:'''Guinaifen:''' Why don't you bring it over to the Luofu, and let me and Sushang have a look
:'''Guinaifen:''' Oh, cutey pie, you look sooo adorable! Let me rub my face against you!
:{Choice} Calm down.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Relax. This thing isn't a cat. It might even be dangerous
:{Choice} It doesn't want to come.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Forget it. It has its own desires. It doesn't want to go anywhere, and just wants to stay at the space station
:'''Guinaifen:''' If I get a chance, I think I can go to it instead. Hmm. Yeah, that should be a work trip for my stream

===(Trailblazer)! You and Luka...===
{{Messages

:'''Guinaifen:''' (Trailblazer)! You and Luka need to watch out!
:{Choice} What's wrong? Don't scare me...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What happened?
::'''Guinaifen:''' I saw some news on the net and I had to tell you about it
:{Choice} You want to avenge Sushang?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is this you wanting to come over and avenge your Shangshang?
::'''Guinaifen:''' Of course I don't like that Shangshang lost! But... I'm not fitting to get on to the Wardance stage...
::'''Guinaifen:''' Wait, we're getting off track. I'm trying to warn you
:'''Guinaifen:''' There are mean comments and rumors about Luka all over the net at the moment
:'''Guinaifen:''' People are saying that he took a bribe from the IPC and was specifically sabotaging the local Xianzhou competitors!
:'''Guinaifen:''' They say that you're hurting the honor of the Xianzhou people, that you're IPC dogs... and some have even said they'll hire professionals to come and teach you a lesson off-line...
:'''Guinaifen:''' Ah, it's all very terrible, basically
:{Choice} That's the internet for you
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's not unusual. You never know if the person you're talking to on the internet is even human
::'''Guinaifen:''' I know, but you have to tell Luka to maintain a positive attitude and not let these rumors affect his performance
:{Choice} You should believe me over them
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We can't change how other people think, but you shouldn't believe it!
::'''Guinaifen:''' Of course I don't believe them! I've seen everything there is on the internet
::'''Guinaifen:''' I just hope that Luka will maintain a positive attitude and not let the rumors affect his performance
:'''Guinaifen:''' He's the man who took Shangshang's hopes of victory on his shoulders and kept fighting all this time. I hope that he can see this tournament through to the very end!
:{Choice} Thanks for the support!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll let him know of your thoughts. See you soon

===Hey fam, remember me?===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Guinaifen:''' Hey fam, remember me?
:{Choice} Of course
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Of course, Little Gui!
::'''Guinaifen:''' Heh, even you started calling me Little Gui
:{Choice} Who are you again?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sorry, met too many people lately, who are you
::'''Guinaifen:''' Ouch, I thought I'd be unforgetable
::'''Guinaifen:''' Aetherium Wars! Interastral Tournament Festival! Guinaifen! Remember now?
:{Choice} Not interested
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sorry, I'm not interested in tea leaves, insurance, or anything else
::'''Guinaifen:''' Augh
::'''Guinaifen:''' What even are those
::'''Guinaifen:''' Aetherium Wars! Interastral Tournament Festival! Guinaifen! Remember now?
:'''Guinaifen:''' We're practically friends!
:'''Guinaifen:''' BTW, I never asked before, where are you from originally?
:{Choice} I'm from the Astral Express
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm but a Nameless aboard the Astral Express
::'''Guinaifen:''' Even a Nameless comes from somewhere
::'''Guinaifen:''' It's fine if you don't wanna spill the beans, we're all fish out of water at some point.
:{Choice} The Cosmos is my home
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I call the whole cosmos my home
::'''Guinaifen:''' Even someone who traverses the cosmos must've come from somewhere
::'''Guinaifen:''' It's fine if you don't wanna spill the beans, we're all fish out of water at some point.
:{Choice} I don't remember
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I actually don't remember where I come from
::'''Guinaifen:''' Oh
::'''Guinaifen:''' Seems like I stumbled on some touchy subjects, my apologies
:'''Guinaifen:''' *sigh* My home world has already been destroyed by the Legion, so I technically don't have a home world either
:'''Guinaifen:''' I guess we are both outworlders who are just temporarily calling the Xianzhou our home
:'''Guinaifen:''' If you ever feel unsure about the Xianzhou life or run into any trouble, come find me anytime
:'''Guinaifen:''' I'm mostly based in the Aurum Alley, working as a street performer, and occasionally doing some livestreaming as a side hustle.
:{Choice} If needed, call me
:'''(Trailblazer):''' If you ever run into any sticky situations or troublesome characters, just give me a holler
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm VERY strong
:'''Guinaifen:''' Aye aye, dependable new friend!
:'''Guinaifen:''' Let's hang out again some time, cheers!

===By the way, how's...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Guinaifen:''' By the way, how's life on the Xianzhou ship treating you? Run into any problems?
:{Choice} I'm cool with it.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Nope, everything's going smoothly for me.
::'''Guinaifen:''' That's awesome to hear. I'm happy for you.
:{Choice} I've run into some challenges
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Well, I have run into a few challenges, to be honest.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Yeah, I totally get it. Been there, done that.
:{Choice} I won't be staying here for long.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Well, I never really thought about it. I won't be staying here forever anyway.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Hmm, maybe you're right...
::'''Guinaifen:''' True, you may not be sticking around for long, but as one of the Nameless, you'll probably have to deal with the Xianzhou often.
:'''Guinaifen:''' So... actually, nothing is up. I was just lost in my thoughts for a moment.
:'''Guinaifen:''' When I first arrived here, I was just a clueless kid.
:'''Guinaifen:''' A kid surrounded by unfamiliar surroundings and a society I knew nothing about.
:'''Guinaifen:''' Thinking about the fear and anxiety I felt back then somehow makes me think of you.
:'''Guinaifen:''' I was worried that you might be feeling the same way.
:{Choice} Thank you for your concern.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Thank you for your concerns, Little Gui. I've grown accustomed to it.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Yeah, I guess so. You've been through a lot more than I have.
:{Choice} I feel bad for you, Little Gui.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Ah, those were tough times for you. It really tugs at my heartstrings.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Hah, don't worry about me. Take better care of yourself! Seriously, make sure you take breaks no matter how busy you are.
:'''Guinaifen:''' Well, let me say it again.
:'''Guinaifen:''' If you ever need help, remember you can always count on me, your Little Gui.
:'''Guinaifen:''' And even if I can't handle it, I have connections in the Cloud Knights and the Ten-Lords Commission!
:'''Guinaifen:''' Heehee!

===Are you there, fam?===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Guinaifen:''' Are you there, fam?
:'''Guinaifen:''' I need suggestions for my livestream!
:{Choice} What suggestions?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah, yeah! I'm here!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What suggestions?
::'''Guinaifen:''' Hey, no pressure!
::'''Guinaifen:''' I just wanna know your thoughts as an outsider.
:{Choice} I'm not sure if I'll be of help...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't know much about livestreaming, and I'm not sure if I'll be of help.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Don't worry! I just need a fresh perspective.
::'''Guinaifen:''' You know, being a streamer for too long makes it hard to come up with something new. That's why I need your suggestions.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Think outside the box! That is!
:'''Guinaifen:''' "Knowledge monetization" seems to be trending these days, right? So I'm thinking about incorporating that into my livestream.
:'''Guinaifen:''' But here's the thing... what kind of knowledge should I share?
:'''Guinaifen:''' I'm trying to think of something popular that only a few people on Luofu can teach.
:'''Guinaifen:''' But now, I'm drawing a blank here.
:{Choice} Teach Xianzhou culture
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How about teaching your followers about Xianzhou culture?
::'''Guinaifen:''' Well, I do know a thing or two about Xianzhou culture, but ultimately, I'm still an outworlder.
::'''Guinaifen:''' There are already a bunch of seasoned folks from the academy covering that topic, so I don't feel like I'd be competitive in that field.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Hold on, that's not true...
::'''Guinaifen:''' I'm totally competitive! Actually, being an outworlder can be a selling point.
::'''Guinaifen:''' "An adorable outworlder girl talking about Xianzhou culture." Hmm, now that's something.
:{Choice} Teach your doggerel skills
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How about teaching your followers about your doggerel skills?
::'''Guinaifen:''' No way! They'll steal my thunder if they end up becoming great performers!
::'''Guinaifen:''' But wait... I see what you're getting at.
::'''Guinaifen:''' You see, street performers never want to teach their unique skills to anyone else.
::'''Guinaifen:''' That's what makes my curriculum special and in demand!
:{Choice} Teach catching bullets with bare hands
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How about teaching your followers how to catch bullets with their bare hands? Seriously, I'd love to learn this trick now!
::'''Guinaifen:''' Come on! Forget it! They'd ban my account if I livestreamed such ridiculously dangerous stunts.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Look at my signature.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Guess why I won't do the bullet stunt?
::'''Guinaifen:''' Because they'd ban my account!
::'''Guinaifen:''' But the idea isn't bad at all... Maybe I can teach my followers the basics of acrobatics, magic tricks, juggling, and stuff like that. I bet a lot of people would be interested.
:'''Guinaifen:''' I'm actually getting some ideas now. Thanks!
:'''Guinaifen:''' Once my curriculum is up and running, I'll give you some free sessions!
