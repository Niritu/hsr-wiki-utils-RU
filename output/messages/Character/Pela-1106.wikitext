:'''Pela:''' Recently, a batch of scraps that don't meet the construction standards have been filtered out at the Pillars of Creation
:'''Pela:''' The staff casually piled these scraps aside for the sake of convenience
:'''Pela:''' But they all disappeared, so I'm suspecting misappropriation
:'''Pela:''' It wouldn't have been a big deal if those scraps aren't that low quality. It'd be bad if someone used it to build a house
:'''Pela:''' If you have any clues, come find me at the work site
