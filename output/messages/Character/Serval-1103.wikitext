:'''(Trailblazer):''' You there? I wanna ask something
:{Choice} About automatons...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Serval, I wanna get some automatons...
:'''Serval:''' Automatons?
:'''Serval:''' I get it, I get it. {{MC|f=Every dashing girl has a dream to drive mechas, right?|m=Every boy has an undying love for mechas, right?}}
:'''Serval:''' Before we continue this conversation, let me get 2 things straight:
:'''Serval:''' 1. Those things don't have a cockpit. You can't sit in it
:'''Serval:''' 2. They are weapons for Silvermane Guards. Not for sale
:{Choice} Is there no other way?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is there no other way?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I saw plenty of abandoned automatons back in Belobog. If we can fix them...
:{Choice} What if I fix one instead...?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I get that the Guards won't sell me a functioning automaton
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But if we can fix those junk scraps that the Guards don't want...
:'''Serval:''' Your brain works pretty fast
:'''Serval:''' We can't sell intact weapons, but won't be breaking the law if we pick a few broken models from the scrapyard and fix them up
:'''Serval:''' Well, I'm gonna send you a coordinate. Go there to find me as soon as you arrive at Belobog~

{{Messages|text=
:'''Serval:''' (Trailblazer)!
:'''Serval:''' Hey, I wanna ask you, did the Silvermane Guards talk to you lately?
:'''Serval:''' Reply ASAP, VERY URGENT
:{Choice} No, why?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' No, why?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
:'''Serval:''' I screwed up
:'''Serval:''' A while ago, a thought occurred to me and I installed an automaton chainsaw on a vehicle
:'''Serval:''' When I stepped on the accelerator, there must've been some structural design flaw
:'''Serval:''' The chainsaw shot out and shattered a window on Qlipoth Fort...
:'''Serval:''' The Silvermane Guards are conducting an all-out manhunt as we speak
:'''Serval:''' If they asked you, remember to say you don't know anything, thanks!
:{Choice} Your secret is safe
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No worries, your secret is safe with me
::'''Serval:''' !!!
::'''Serval:''' Thank you so much!
::'''Serval:''' When my new song is released, I'll send you a signed copy of my album~
:{Choice} I'll answer honestly
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No problem, I will be as honest as possible
::'''Serval:''' !!!
::'''Serval:''' Even you have become so untrustworthy
:{Choice} Why tell me?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So why are you telling me everything...
::'''Serval:''' ...
::'''Serval:''' Things like this, it's so obvious I was the one who did it!
::'''Serval:''' I was worried that you might hand me over reflexively when you were questioned...
:'''Serval:''' Shoot, someone's coming
:'''Serval:''' Talk later
