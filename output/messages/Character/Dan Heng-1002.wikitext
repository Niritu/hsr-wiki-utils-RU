::'''Dan Heng:''' I want to meet the current high elder of the Luofu Vidyadhara.
:{Choice} Want me as a bodyguard?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So you're worried that someone on the Xianzhou might want to hurt you, and want me as your bodyguard?
::'''Dan Heng:''' You jest. I want to meet the current high elder of the Luofu Vidyadhara.
:'''Dan Heng:''' I want to ask about some bygone matters, so that I will better understand what I can still do to make amends for my past life.

===I think we only...===
{{Messages
|start_condition = 
|text =
:'''Dan Heng:''' I think we only scratched the surface of this Ifrit.
:{Choice} What happened?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What happened?
:'''Dan Heng:''' The fire demons of Fetora are ferocious and cruel by nature, but Ifrit easily rose to the position of clan leader.
:'''Dan Heng:''' And even among the fire demons, his flame belongs to a special category.
:{Choice} Wdym?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What do you mean?
:'''Dan Heng:''' In many vicious incidents instigated by the Ever-Flame Mansion, I found similar eyewitness reports claiming that "miscreants materialized from the inferno."
:'''Dan Heng:''' I speculate that Ifrit's flame may have inherited some ability other than burning, and that is related to his origin.
:'''Dan Heng:''' I have heard of a flame with similar properties that was difficult to capture because it kept shifting between phases.
:'''Dan Heng:''' There is not much information about it, only one line that catches the eye: "Burns through worlds, leaving numerous scions of flame behind."
:'''Dan Heng:''' Ifrit... is perhaps one of its descendants.
:{Choice} Shifting between phases...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Shifting between phases...
:'''Dan Heng:''' That's all I have.
:'''Dan Heng:''' The number of related records is limited. I'm not sure if that was helpful to you.
:{Choice} Enough.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It's enough, thanks
:'''Dan Heng:''' That's good.

:'''Dan Heng:''' From the Annihilation Gang?
:'''Dan Heng:''' It's best not to get involved with him.
:{Choice} The space station is in trouble.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' The space station's met with some trouble, and it has something to do with him

:'''Dan Heng:''' I'm observing a never-before-seen creature.
:'''Dan Heng:''' It would be tomorrow morning when I finish collecting everything I need for the data bank.

:{Choice} Honestly, no
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Honestly, no.
::'''Dan Heng:''' I thought so.
:{Choice} Slightly, maybe
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Slightly, maybe.
::'''Dan Heng:''' Don't worry. No need to push yourself.
:'''Dan Heng:''' Furthermore, they're quite vigilant and difficult to observe. They'll scatter the moment they perceive any potential danger.
:'''Dan Heng:''' I'm thinking about choosing another location to observe them...
:{Choice} Go up the trees
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Go up the trees
::'''Dan Heng:''' Using leaves to camouflage oneself? That might be a good idea.

===Found an old Express...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Dan Heng:''' Found an old Express communication log in the data bank, and one of the categories is Dad Jokes.
:'''Dan Heng:''' I don't fully understand it, but my instincts tell me you should be able to.
:{Choice} Am I like that?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So, this is the kind of person I am in your mind?
::'''Dan Heng:''' Yes.
:{Choice} I don't understand
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't understand
::'''Dan Heng:''' I don't think you've seen the log yet...
:'''Dan Heng:''' This is what it says.
:'''Dan Heng:''' "On watchkeeping duty with Himeko. She's talking in her sleep." Pom-Pom
:'''Dan Heng:''' There's another entry an hour later.
:'''Dan Heng:''' "On watchkeeping duty with Pom-Pom. They have been talking in their sleep for almost an hour." Himeko

:{Choice} ...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ...
::'''Dan Heng:''' Okay, looks like this categorization tag can stay for now.
:{Choice} This is clearly a horror story
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is clearly a horror story
::'''Dan Heng:''' Is it? I didn't understand it, but sounds like we need an extra tag for it.
:'''Dan Heng:''' The log stops there. I asked Himeko and Pom-Pom. Neither of them remembered the incident.

===Having studied with Bailu,...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Dan Heng:''' Having studied with Bailu, I now deeply feel the profound and fascinating pharmacology behind the use of medicinal herbs.
:{Choice} Is this emergency medicine as well?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Are they emergency medicines?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Seems like she gave Pom-Pom some before
::'''Dan Heng:''' Is that so?
::'''Dan Heng:''' Emergency medicine can be ingested directly. They are very convenient.
:{Choice} Are there any tasty medicines?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Are there any tasty medicines?
::'''Dan Heng:''' ...There might be. I will have to research this when I have time.
:'''Dan Heng:''' She mentioned her philosophy regarding there being "a special cure for each person." If I can master her teachings, I think I might be able to create medication suited to everyone on the Express.
:'''Dan Heng:''' Speaking of which, the fact that I don't know any cloudhymn magic that can heal is... saddening.
:{Choice} Ask the Omni-Synthesizer?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Maybe you should consult the Omni-Synthesizer?
::'''Dan Heng:''' Perhaps asking Bailu will make things faster.
:{Choice} Dan Heng's not all-capable...?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' By the Aeons, Dan Heng's not all-capable...
::'''Dan Heng:''' I still have much to learn.
:{Choice} You don't remember anything at all?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You don't remember anything at all?
::'''Dan Heng:''' I do not possess such power.
:'''Dan Heng:''' Though the power of the high elder is rooted in legacy, to me, it is more like a certain type of "knowledge" rather than "memories."
:'''Dan Heng:''' The stories that I can see... They have existed long before I was even self-aware.
:{Choice} It's all up to you
::'''(Trailblazer):''' If it's like "knowledge," then maybe it's up to you on how to use them
::'''Dan Heng:''' Is that so?
::'''Dan Heng:''' I hope I made the right choice.
::{Choice} You've helped many people
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You've helped many people
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Including me, of course
::'''Dan Heng:''' That's good.
:{Choice} I want to know everything too
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I want to know everything too
::'''Dan Heng:''' The sensation is a miserable one. Your mind is filled with uncountable scenes and noises, but you are never present.
::{Choice} Like the Voice of the Stellaron?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I can't completely understand what you're feeling, but is it kinda like the Voice of the Stellaron?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It takes some time to get used to
::'''Dan Heng:''' Perhaps.
::'''Dan Heng:''' Perhaps one day I will be able to co-exist with it, just like you do with yours.

===Do you have nightmares?===

::{Choice} I destroyed the world

::'''Dan Heng:''' Do you have these same worries when you have nightmares?
::{Choice} No, and I don't really care
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' You know, until you asked that question, I didn't consider the possibility...
::{Choice} Yeah, but I can't prove it
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah, but I don't have any evidence to prove that such things ever happened...
::{Choice} If you can't remember, then it didn't happen.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't know... But I can't remember anything, so just treat it as if it never happened...
::'''Dan Heng:''' That is a response only you could give.
::{Choice} That's what trailblazing taught me
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's what trailblazing taught me. Didn't expect that, did you?
:::'''Dan Heng:''' Very well. To education, then.
::{Choice} That's what you taught me

:{Choice} No
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No, I sleep pretty good.
::{Choice} Are you having nightmares?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why? Are you having nightmares?
::'''Dan Heng:''' Yes.
::'''Dan Heng:''' Sometimes, I dream of destroying the world. Other times, I dream of losing my companions. Sometimes, I even dream that I'm not myself.
::'''Dan Heng:''' I wish those scenes would only remain in my dreams, but some things... I'm not sure whether they had really happened...
::'''Dan Heng:''' If it were you, would you have such worries?
::{Choice} I don't really care about these things
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I probably won't care about this stuff. What happened in the past has nothing to do with the person I am right now...
::{Choice} Caring doesn't change anything
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Whether I worry has nothing to do with whether these things actually happened...
::{Choice} If you can't remember, then it didn't happen.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't remember anything now, so I just treat it as if it never happened...
::'''Dan Heng:''' That is a response only you could give.
::{Choice} That's what trailblazing taught me

:{Choice} It doesn't matter what happened...
