===(Trailblazer), how do you...===

:'''Argenti:''' (Trailblazer), how do you fare? Have you all reached Washtopia?
:{Choice} Feels great!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Feeling pretty good. The Express is safely at the station now!
:{Choice} Not good...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It doesn't feel like we've gotten over it... but the Express is safely at the station already!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' We scrubbed the Express clean inside and out with the staff at Washtopia...
:'''Argenti:''' That's good.
:'''Argenti:''' (Trailblazer), I have been hesitating about whether or not to tell you something.
:'''Argenti:''' I am uncertain whether you have noticed this, but...
:'''Argenti:''' There's a fourth bug in the Express.
:{Choice} Huh? A fourth one?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I didn't realize that at all!
:'''Argenti:''' It's hiding inside Velite's armor, a mini insect. However, it was none other than the overlord they mentioned.
:'''Argenti:''' The Giant Sting is at the bottom of the ladder to them
:{Choice} So the overlord is not the Giant Sting
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But the overlord is small enough to hide inside Velite's armor
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It must have quite the temper, too
:{Choice} Ha, the big guy is what rank?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The biggest is the least powerful...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I thought that one was the overlord
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Maybe it looks super scary, too
:'''Argenti:''' When I tracked down Velite, he said he saw himself flying, and steering the One and Only.
:'''Argenti:''' I helped him to defeat the insect boss. However, he seemed a little lost after the illusion faded away.
:{Choice} He's still "obsessed"!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's like when you see beautiful things
::'''(Trailblazer):''' And yet he says he has no obsessions and is immune to hallucinations
:{Choice} I think he gave up being a pilot
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I remembered he said he wanted to be a pilot
::'''(Trailblazer):''' And yet he says he has no obsessions and is immune to hallucinations
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I suspect he was quietly affected by you...
:'''Argenti:''' He thought it over for a few days, but for some reason chose to give up this idea of using currency to spread Beauty... He seemed keen to become a pilot instead, and I showed him my support.
:'''Argenti:''' However, regarding the basis of the hallucination... (Trailblazer), I'm still confounded.
:'''Argenti:''' According to you, the wing dust made everyone see the same fireworks at the end... Why?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Heh, everyone longs to return to the stars. That thought's too strong
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It's also what everyone saw as a medal ceremony to you, Argenti!

:'''Argenti:''' (Trailblazer)

:::'''Argenti:''' Trust me. It's not embarrassing once you get used to it. Please come to me often and let me shower you with compliments, (Trailblazer).

===(Trailblazer), I just finished...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Argenti:''' (Trailblazer), I just finished a space race during my journey
:{Choice} A space race?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Space race...? What's that?
:{Choice} Looks like you enjoyed yourself.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What's got you so thrilled?
:'''Argenti:''' Oh, nothing, it's only the highest level of racing competition in the entire cosmos
:'''Argenti:''' That's why every year, I make modifications to the engine of the One and Only
:'''Argenti:''' All types of aircrafts, ships, and shuttles are welcome to participate in the race.
:'''Argenti:''' And if you're interested, I can make introductions for the Astral Express to join the competition
:'''Argenti:''' We do, however, encounter dust storms during the race from time to time
:'''Argenti:''' These storms bring in star debris that sticks to the One and Only. It shines so brightly that I can't help bringing myself to remove the debris every time I see it
:{Choice} Pom-Pom once mentioned it too...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh, yeah. Pom-Pom once mentioned that too
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We once got caught in a dust storm, too
::'''Argenti:''' That substance clings to my armor and glows
::'''Argenti:''' And it might get stuck in Pom-Pom's fur, making it a hassle to clean
::{Choice} Shiny Pom-Pom!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm already picturing it in my mind
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Shiny Pom-Pom!
:{Choice} I'd love to see Pom-Pom in the race.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'd love to see Pom-Pom driving the Astral Express in the race
::'''Argenti:''' I believe the Astral Express would impress everyone
::'''Argenti:''' I'm looking forward to competing with you
:'''Argenti:''' Alright, enough small talk for today. I have to clean my One and Only
:'''Argenti:''' When the opportunity arises, I'd like to invite (Trailblazer) and the Crew to participate in the race

:'''Argenti:''' (Trailblazer)
:'''Argenti:''' I'm struggling with what to have for dinner tonight.
:'''Argenti:''' This might seem sudden, but I need your opinion on flavors.
:'''Argenti:''' Which one do you like best, (Trailblazer)? Soft bread, hard bread, or perhaps buttered bread?
:{Choice} Soft bread.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Fluffy soft bread with a sweet flavor sounds like a great choice...
::'''Argenti:''' Yes, it's indeed a great choice.
:{Choice} Hard bread.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I think hard bread with its coarse texture would suit you.
::'''Argenti:''' Excellent. That's actually my favorite.
:{Choice} Buttered bread.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How about trying buttered bread? It could be something new for you.
::'''Argenti:''' Hmm, that sounds interesting. Maybe I'll give it a try.
:'''Argenti:''' Due to my rigorous training and constant traveling, I rarely had anything other than hard bread.
:'''Argenti:''' But of course, I personally enjoy its rustic texture and slightly bitter flavor.
:'''Argenti:''' It's just like the serene view outside the window right now.
:'''Argenti:''' Great. I'll go with my usual choice of hard bread.
:'''Argenti:''' Do you have any recommendations for what to have with it?
:{Choice} Milk.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Milk would be a perfect pairing.
:{Choice} Sausage.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Perhaps some savory sausage.
:{Choice} Bread.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What could be the best pair for hard bread?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The answer is: Another type of bread.
:'''Argenti:''' Great. Please accept my gratitude.
