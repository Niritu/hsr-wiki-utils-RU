===Greetings, (Trailblazer). The Seat...===

:'''Jing Yuan:''' Greetings, (Trailblazer).<br />The Seat of Divine Foresight is currently collaborating with the Ten-Lords Commission's spiritfarers in pursuit of a heinous crime, and requires your assistance.<br />Might I inquire if you have recently received any parcels of mysterious origin?
:{Choice} I have it on me
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I have it on me
::'''Jing Yuan:''' Oh-ho, this will be simple then.
:{Choice} I didn't receive anything
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I didn't receive anything
::'''Jing Yuan:''' How odd. Is it possible that there are errors in the report submitted by Qingzu?
:{Choice} What parcels?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What parcels?
::'''Jing Yuan:''' How odd. Were you not made aware of this issue?
:'''Jing Yuan:''' To be frank, the parcel could be from the Annihilation Gang. Those violent followers of the Ruin Author were trying to upend the Xianzhou with it.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' If you do receive parcels of such description, please hand it over to Qingzu at the Seat of Divine Foresight. She shall forward the item to the experts in the Ten-Lords Commission to handle it.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Of course, if you have any other means of destruction that would not cause any danger, please feel free to use them. Just remember to update Qingzu after it is done.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' At present, I have urgent matters to attend to. I won't be able to respond from now.

==Daily==
===(Trailblazer), I finished reading...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Jing Yuan:''' (Trailblazer), I finished reading the files that you shared with me from the data bank.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' After sitting in this Seat of Divine Foresight for so long, I can't help but overlook the world outside of Luofu's delves.<br />That, combined with the long lifespan of the Xianzhou humans, made me feel that the entire world is as boring and changeless as myself.<br />However, now I've read the wondrous encounters of the Express Crew, I realized that using my endless lifespan to travel various worlds would be a fun venture indeed.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Unfortunately... I still shoulder Luofu's countless duties and cannot accompany your group. But if I were to retire one day, what should I do?
:{Choice} Become a Nameless
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Our Express is pretty big. You can come visit, general
::'''Jing Yuan:''' Hahahaha, if that's a personal invitation, (Trailblazer), then I might consider it.
:{Choice} Take Fu Xuan's job
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Perhaps you can swap places with Fu Xuan and be the master diviner
::'''Jing Yuan:''' Hahaha, don't ever mention that to me again. The master diviner is an exceedingly busy job. No ordinary person can face its arduous work.
:{Choice} Work for the Realm-Keeping Commission
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I feel the Realm-Keeping Commission's work is quite relaxed...
::'''Jing Yuan:''' Hahaha, that would truly take me back to my origins.
::'''Jing Yuan:''' My parents were scholars of the Realm-Keeping Commission and were responsible for researching and recording the histories of long-life species. The paperwork involved was literal torment.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' That reminds me... My dream as a young boy was to become a Galaxy Ranger.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Pity that life never goes the way you want it to go.
:{Choice} If given the chance...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' If given the chance, where would you want to go?
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Perhaps I'll go seek out animals that have already gone extinct in Xianzhou.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Let us stop for today. Qingzu just carried in another pile of documents for me. Just looking at them gives me a headache.
:{Choice} You're working hard, general!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' You're working hard, general!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm sorry I can't be of help...
:'''Jing Yuan:''' It's enough for me to squeeze out some time to chat with you, (Trailblazer).
:'''Jing Yuan:''' All in all, I shall return to work. Farewell!

===(Trailblazer), I have a...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Jing Yuan:''' (Trailblazer), I have a rather abrupt request.
:{Choice} Please let me hear it, general!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Please let me hear it, general!
:'''Jing Yuan:''' When you are free, could you please spend some time sparring with Yanqing?
:{Choice} I wouldn't dare!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I've heard about Yanqing's sword skills and how he learned those from you, general
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I wouldn't dare to spar with him
::'''Jing Yuan:''' Haha, is that so? You are exceedingly humble.
:{Choice} I can, but...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I can, but...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I heard that you are his teacher, general...
::'''Jing Yuan:''' That is true. What of it?
:{Choice} Who's Yanqing?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Who's Yanqing?
::'''Jing Yuan:''' My disciple and also a lieutenant of the Cloud Knights.
:{Choice} Then, can I spar with...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Then, can I spar with you first?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' That way, you also get to test my capabilities
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Haha, I am already well aware of your capabilities, (Trailblazer).
:{Choice} Oh my. You saw through me
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh my. You saw through me
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You've exposed the fact that I don't know how to use a sword at all
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|&lbrack;cry&rbrack;]]
::'''Jing Yuan:''' You don't use a sword, and therefore don't abide by the rules and conventions of a sword fight. For Yanqing to try his skills against such an opponent would be a supreme opportunity.
:{Choice} I am indeed very strong
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I am indeed very strong
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I didn't think you'd see through me this quickly, general
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px|&lbrack;Shocked&rbrack;]]
::'''Jing Yuan:''' That's to be expected. Strength does not only constitute just your physical power, skill, or weapon. It's also a matter of wisdom and tenacity. My instincts as a war veteran are to be trusted.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' As for a spar between you and me... perhaps it's better to plan for that after you've sparred with Yanqing.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' However, I have one request. If you cannot agree to it, (Trailblazer), then we cannot fight.
:{Choice} Please let me hear it, general!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Please let me hear it, general!
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Do not book our spar for the afternoon. That time is far too tiring and sleepy.

===Pardon me, (Trailblazer), but...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Pardon me, (Trailblazer), but I wonder whether you have the time to come to the Seat of Divine Foresight right now for a game of Xianzhou starchess?
:{Choice} Can I even get inside the Seat of Divine Foresight?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Can I even get inside the Seat of Divine Foresight?
::'''Jing Yuan:''' I will simply let the Cloud Knights know.
:{Choice} I don't know how to play Xianzhou starchess
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't know how to play Xianzhou starchess
::'''Jing Yuan:''' It is not difficult. I can teach you.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Do you recall the giant sandpit in the middle of the Seat of Divine Foresight? It is only used to project military objectives during war times. During peaceful days, I use it as a game board.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' I like to study starchess puzzles in books when I'm free, but there are only so many of them. Once I've solved all the puzzles, I still need to seek out real opponents.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Would you be interested?
:{Choice} Of course.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Of course.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Since the general is inviting me, then I will learn this game no matter how hard it is
::'''Jing Yuan:''' Haha. In that case, I'll tell you the truth of what's happening without fear of you laughing at me, (Trailblazer)
:{Choice} Let me think...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Let me think...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I really don't know how to play. I don't want to ruin your mood, general
::'''Jing Yuan:''' I apologize. Did I scare you? In that case, I'll tell you the truth of what's happening without fear of you laughing at me, (Trailblazer)
:'''Jing Yuan:''' The teahouse sent over a collection of new releases from Immortal's Delight, but I'm the only person in the Seat of Divine Foresight right now. I can't finish these teas, and I didn't want to refuse the teahouse's goodwill...
:{Choice} I will head over immediately to help, general!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I will head over immediately to help, general!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 03.png|80px|&lbrack;Expectant&rbrack;]]
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Hahaha, excellent.

===(Trailblazer), is everything alright...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Jing Yuan:''' (Trailblazer), is everything alright on the Express?
:{Choice} Are you feeling alright?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Seems fine, are you feeling alright?
::'''Jing Yuan:''' Haha, nothing too serious. After a few days cooped up in the apothecary, my injuries have healed to the point of being negligible.
::'''Jing Yuan:''' It must've been because that fight was close to the Ambrosial Arbor, so my body's healing speed exceeded all expectations.
:{Choice} What made you think of us?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What made you think of us, General?
::'''Jing Yuan:''' The Express Crew are my friends who went through life and death with me. Isn't it normal to think about my friends?
:'''Jing Yuan:''' By the way, (Trailblazer), perhaps you've already heard from Dan Heng about some recent events.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' My mentor has returned to the Luofu, gathering old friends to settle past grudges. She sent an anonymous letter to the Express to invite Dan Heng, which is quite... abrupt. I hope it hasn't caused any disturbance to everyone.
:{Choice} No worries
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No worries, we have weathered worse storms
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Your mentor is something else to be able to move on the Express unnoticed. After I found the letter, I only told Pom-Pom and Dan Heng, no one else
:{Choice} It's indeed a bit spooky
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Your mentor is something else to be able to leave the letter on the Express unnoticed
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I only told the conductor and Dan Heng, no one else. Pom-Pom seems a little worried...
::'''Jing Yuan:''' Please relay my apology to the conductor for the rudeness of my mentor.
:{Choice} Is Dan Heng okay?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Dan Heng looked really serious after I received the letter. Is he okay?
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Dan Heng accepted the invitation. I admire his courage in facing the karma of his past life and understand his determination in this life. I will do my best to defuse the hostility that the Luofu has toward him.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' The matters regarding Dan Heng should come to a temporary conclusion. However, it seems the Alliance's situation is about to change again.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' I hear the Express will be journeying far again. I hope for your peace and safety.
:{Choice} You too!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Same to you, General!
:{Choice} We'll come visit!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Dan Heng, I, and everyone else on the Express will definitely come back to visit!
:'''Jing Yuan:''' Alright, I have a little something for everyone, consider it an apology for the troubles.
:'''Jing Yuan:''' If you require any aid or need a place to dock the Express, the Luofu will forever welcome your contingent.
