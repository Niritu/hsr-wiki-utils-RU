:'''Ruan Mei:''' How are those two doing lately?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Did they learn how to co-exist?
:{Choice} I left it in the space station
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I accommodated them in the space station
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I taught Molten Cheese Tart to master humility and let Gray Bean Paste have a positive outlook on life
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Didn't realize you still cared about them
:{Choice} So, you do care about them
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Didn't realize you still cared about them
::'''Ruan Mei:''' Mm, a little.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I accommodated them in the space station
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I taught Molten Cheese Tart to master humility and let Gray Bean Paste have a positive outlook on life
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Thank you, (Trailblazer).
:{Choice} Don't worry about it
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't worry about it
::'''(Trailblazer):''' When would I forget you?
::'''Ruan Mei:''' Maybe eventually.
:{Choice} ...When would I forget you?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' When would I forget you?
::'''Ruan Mei:''' Maybe eventually.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I look forward to experiencing new stories with you
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Ok, I promise.
:'''Ruan Mei:''' In the future, research will still continue.
:{Choice} Right, about the alabaster head...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Right, that alabaster head...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Is he a friend of yours?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' ...

===This creation looks very...===

:{Choice} (Send the picture to Ruan Mei)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' This creation looks very much like you... it's like a miracle
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Message Ruan Mei 37.png|256px]]
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I didn't think they would surprise me like this. When I was nurturing them, I didn't expect something like this would happen
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Are you... taking care of them? How is everything these days?
:{Choice} How I've been recently?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Are you asking how I've been recently? Not bad
::'''Ruan Mei:''' Hm....
:{Choice} How they've been recently?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Are you asking how they've been recently? Not bad
::'''(Trailblazer):''' They're hanging out pretty nicely on the space station. They don't really have any worries besides missing you
::'''Ruan Mei:''' [[undefined|80px|&lbrack;sigh&rbrack;]]
:'''Ruan Mei:''' When you have time, can you take a full "family photo" of them for me?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I'm curious what will become of these little lifeforms with their genes passing down through generations
:{Choice} You're not coming back to visit them?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But... they all really want to see you. Are you sure you don't want to come back and visit them?
:{Choice} Ok, I promise.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Ok, I promise
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I'm about to go on a faraway journey. Beyond the service area of a beacon. You can leave me messages, and I will give them a closer look when I return

===(Trailblazer), have you seen Stephen?===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Ruan Mei:''' (Trailblazer), have you seen Stephen?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' He's missing, and not even Screwllum and Herta can find him. I bet he must be slacking off somewhere
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I hope he's not asleep
:{Choice} I don't even know what he looks like...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't even know what he looks like...
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Oh, hold on a second
:'''Ruan Mei:''' He took the bait. I found him
:{Choice} That was fast!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' That was fast!
:'''Ruan Mei:''' All the credit goes to the "Stephen Bait"
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Despite the name, it's actually quite simple
:'''Ruan Mei:''' All you need is a piece of fruit cake
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Doesn't matter how much you get. As long as the flavor is right, it will get the job done
:{Choice} Is there a Herta Bait
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is there a "Herta Bait"!?
::'''Ruan Mei:''' Herta has clear preferences. An interesting Curio should do the trick.
:{Choice} Is there a Screwllum Bait
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is there a "Screwllum Bait"!?
::'''Ruan Mei:''' Screwllum has always been punctual. The cuff links I prepare for him never come in handy.
:{Choice} Is there a "Ruan Mei Bait"?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm curious about "Ruan Mei Bait" too
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Me?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Take a guess
:{Choice} Plum blossom cake
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Plum blossom cake?
::'''Ruan Mei:''' More or less
::'''Ruan Mei:''' The aroma of plum blossom cake always brings me back to the time I spent in the lab with my mother when I was little. I loved to show off my work to her at that time
::'''Ruan Mei:''' Instead of bait, I think it's more of a reward to me, which I do miss a lot
:{Choice} Is it... some kinda research?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is it some kind of research?
::'''Ruan Mei:''' It's human nature to be inquisitive, and all research has a purpose
::'''Ruan Mei:''' But for me, there are only certain kinds of research that are worthy of my attention...
:{Choice} Can I be your bait?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Can I be your bait?
::'''Ruan Mei:''' Alas
::'''Ruan Mei:''' Looks like the Anti-Truth Serum hasn't worn off yet

:{Choice} What's wrong?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What's wrong?

:{Choice} Is this pocket texting?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Okay, is this accidental pocket texting again?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So many messages bombarding me with stickers these days...
:{Choice} Who are you?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Who is it this time?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So many messages bombarding me with stickers these days...
:{Choice} Stickers are so fun!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Stickers are so fun!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I enjoy sharing new stickers with my friends too.
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Sorry
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I'm in the middle of research for a new lifeform
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Hold on a second
:'''Ruan Mei:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 02.png|80px]]
:'''Ruan Mei:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 01.png|80px]]
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Ruan Mei has gone offline
:'''Ruan Mei:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 09.png|80px]]
:'''Ruan Mei:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 04.png|80px]]
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Ruan Mei has come online
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Okay. I've wrapped it up
:{Choice} What happened?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What happened?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I'm nurturing a new lifeform
:'''Ruan Mei:''' It possesses intelligence, but I can't assess its exact level yet
:'''Ruan Mei:''' It is not susceptible to injury, but it needs the help of other mediums to survive
:{Choice} I don't understand at all
::'''(Trailblazer):''' With all due respect, I don't understand a thing you just said
:{Choice} I think I get it
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I think I get it, but not fully
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Are the stickers you see merely stickers?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Or could they be a special kind of lifeform?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' They use a language made up of pictures and reproduce when they are sent in messages
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Well... There's a chance they might have already settled down in your phone
:{Choice} What!?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What!?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Do you believe what I said?
:{Choice} I do
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I believe what you're saying, some stickers can be like their own little lifeforms
::'''Ruan Mei:''' That's great
:{Choice} You're pulling my leg
::'''(Trailblazer):''' There's nothing special about these stickers, no matter how I see them. You're pulling my leg, aren't you?
::'''Ruan Mei:''' No worries, just take it as me joking around
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I've got to get back to my research

===(Trailblazer), you often test...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Ruan Mei:''' (Trailblazer), you often test the Simulated Universe for Herta, don't you?
:{Choice} I'm not there right now
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Unfortunately, I'm not there right now
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I can make a trip there when I'm free. What's the matter?
:{Choice} I happen to be testing it now
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How serendipitous! I'm testing it now
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What can your "humble assistant" do for you?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I lost a set of Ruan strings, which should be in Herta's office
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I've got a spare, so there's no rush
:'''Ruan Mei:''' If you happen to stumble on it, please bring it back for me. Thanks in advance
:'''Ruan Mei:''' If Herta asks anything, just tell her I got so mesmerized by her portrait that I forgot about the strings. She shouldn't probe any further
:{Choice} That's so unconvincing
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds unconvincing to me
:{Choice} That's so flattering
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds so flattering
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I'm merely stating facts here
:'''Ruan Mei:''' Herta's beauty is unquestionable, just like her foul temper
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I can't help getting absorbed in the research results whenever I'm at the space station. If I leave something behind, that's the excuse I use, and it always works
:{Choice} You left behind other things before?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' So you left behind other things before?
:'''Ruan Mei:''' I did
:'''Ruan Mei:''' A piece of embroidery, a lifeform nurturing notebook, and the Phase Flame of #29 Sserkal
:{Choice} Embroidery?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Embroidery... You like doing it in your free time, don't you?
::'''Ruan Mei:''' Yes. I made an embroidery of the Blue when I was nearby the railway platform
::'''Ruan Mei:''' It's still missing. Perhaps, some researcher picked it up
::'''Ruan Mei:''' I hope it's in the hands of someone who appreciates it
:{Choice} Lifeform nurturing notebook?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Lifeform nurturing notebook? I think I've seen it somewhere...
::'''Ruan Mei:''' There are researchers who want to duplicate my creations. They do it by circulating poor imitations of my research formulae secretly
::'''Ruan Mei:''' However, the ingredients aren't the key when it comes to nurturing lifeforms
::'''Ruan Mei:''' The most important thing is the spark of inspiration when coming up with the formula
:{Choice} Phase Flame?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Phase Flame? Is Herta aware of it?
::'''Ruan Mei:''' She is. It is just one of many in her collection
::'''Ruan Mei:''' She won't be bothered by it
