::'''(Trailblazer):''' Am I getting roped into unpaid labor again?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Today is gonna be another fulfilling day
::'''Aglaea:''' Compared to assignments, this is more along the lines of a request between friends
:{Choice} I'm so honored!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Being personally named by Lady Aglaea...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is a great honor!
::'''Aglaea:''' You needn't stand on ceremony. Consider it a favor among friends

===Not sure if you're...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Aglaea:''' Not sure if you're into watching plays, (Trailblazer)
:'''Aglaea:''' A batch of new plays has been released, and I have reserved some seats for you
:{Choice} What plays?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What plays?
::'''Aglaea:''' Well, let me introduce them to you
:{Choice} Not interested
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Not interested
::'''Aglaea:''' It won't hurt to hear about them
:{Choice} I wanna see Rosy Celestial Maiden
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is Nikador Battles the Rosy Celestial Maiden on?
::'''Aglaea:''' Oh, such works are not uncommon
:'''Aglaea:''' Amphoreus' theater scene is vibrant, featuring an array of spectacular plays
:'''Aglaea:''' Such as the universally known and acclaimed classics, "The Aidonians," and "The Okheman Women"...
:'''Aglaea:''' Apart from serious works, some light-hearted, comedic plays are also quite popular
:'''Aglaea:''' For instance, this season includes titles like "Zagreus the Tyrant Falls in Love With Me," "I Turned into a Talking Dromas After A Nap," and "Fortress Kremnos"...
:'''Aglaea:''' I've heard these plays have a style quite distinct from the classics. Such a shame I haven't had the chance to see them yet
:{Choice} I really love these!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I really love these kinds of shows!
:{Choice} Our tastes align!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The tastes of the entire Cosmos align!
::'''Aglaea:''' Is that so? It could be an eventuality as art evolves
:{Choice} Everyone needs a break
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Everyone needs a break now and then
:'''Aglaea:''' These plays look like a ton of fun. It's no surprise they're so popular
:'''Aglaea:''' Let's chat about your thoughts once you've seen them

===A new fashion trend...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Aglaea:''' A new fashion trend has swept through Okhema
:'''Aglaea:''' Youngsters would occasionally mimic the legendary heroes of Amphoreus by dressing in similar outfits and gathering at the plaza
:'''Aglaea:''' Lately, I've seen many take inspiration from your group's attire
:{Choice} That's called cosplay
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's all part of costume play
::'''Aglaea:''' You seem to know a lot about this
:{Choice} How dare they wear my clothes
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How dare they wear my clothes without me knowing?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is copyrighted!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px]]
::'''Aglaea:''' Your arrival has made an indelible impression on the people of Okhema
:{Choice} I'll join too!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll join in too! I'll play as myself
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 01.png|80px]]
::'''Aglaea:''' The residents of Okhema would certainly appreciate it
:'''Aglaea:''' It's probably a professional quirk, but your outfits really caught my eye when we first met
:'''Aglaea:''' The tailoring is sculptural, with a distinctly architectural aesthetic
:'''Aglaea:''' The stitching is diverse, with some techniques that are unfamiliar even to me
:'''Aglaea:''' The bold, yet tasteful choice of colors matches well with each of your individual qualities
:'''Aglaea:''' It gives me, as a dressmaster, a lot of new inspiration
:'''Aglaea:''' If you'd like, I can recommend some local outfits for you
:{Choice} What do you think would suit me?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What do you think would suit me?
::'''Aglaea:''' Let me think about it
::'''Aglaea:''' Perhaps a black hooded cloak &mdash; it's a timeless classic
:{Choice} How about something a true hero would wear!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How about something a true hero would wear!
::'''Aglaea:''' Haha, aren't you already wearing one?
:{Choice} I'd love to try on your dress
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'd love to try on something like yours &mdash; I like it
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px]]
::'''Aglaea:''' Clothing should be tailored to fit &mdash; everyone has their own style
::'''Aglaea:''' These days, I lean toward simple and elegant outfits, but I can customize them to suit your preferences
:'''Aglaea:''' I once had a passion for collecting beautiful garments and even had a wardrobe as large as a house
:'''Aglaea:''' However, I now hope that clothes are available to anyone who needs them, rather than solely belonging to me

===(Trailblazer), interested in trying...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Aglaea:''' (Trailblazer), interested in trying some unique baths?
:'''Aglaea:''' They often feature unique pools and bathing techniques. After a trial period, they would be promoted in the Marmoreal Palace
:'''Aglaea:''' The bathing experience in Okhema is unforgettable, and I strongly recommend giving it a try
:'''Aglaea:''' For instance, a bath infused with seven-colored bath salts, targeting its stimulation to exhausted parts of your body
:'''Aglaea:''' While you enjoy a lively debate, our bath attendants will squeeze fresh pomegranates and drench you in the luxurious juice
:'''Aglaea:''' Then, they will gently massage and pat your skin until it feels silky smooth like a ripe fruit
:'''Aglaea:''' After your bath, try your luck with our endless raffle services, a therapeutic back massage by a dromas...
:{Choice} Wait, what? A dromas?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait, what? A dromas?
::'''Aglaea:''' Don't worry. These dromas are specially trained and know how to control their strength perfectly
:{Choice} Where's the Spicy Hot Oil Bath?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' If there's no Spicy Hot Oil Bath, count me out
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You should take some inspiration from my room
::'''Aglaea:''' I would love to visit sometime
:'''Aglaea:''' Hmm... speaking of which, it's about time for my daily trip to the baths
:'''Aglaea:''' See you later then
:{Choice} You go every day?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You go every day?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Aren't you very busy?
:{Choice} Won't you get pruney?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't you worry about getting pruney?
:'''Aglaea:''' Yes, which is why I can't indulge three times a day, just a daily treat for myself
