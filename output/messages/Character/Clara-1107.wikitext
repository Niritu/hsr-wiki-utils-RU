:{Choice} Cute emoticons...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Clara, your emoticons are so cute (ﾟ3ﾟ)
::'''Clara:''' Thank you...
:'''Clara:''' Actually, the Robot Settlement has been met with some issues recently
:'''Clara:''' {{MC|f=Big sister|m=Big brother}}, come have a look please...
:'''Clara:''' If you have the time...
:{Choice} Don't worry, I'll be right there
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't worry, I'll be there right away.
:{Choice} Really (☉д⊙)...

:'''Clara:''' {{MC|f=Big sister|m=Big brother}}, are you free now?
:'''Clara:''' I want to talk about Pascal...
:{Choice} Are you still sad...?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Are you still sad...?
::'''Clara:''' No... I've calmed down
:{Choice} Okay. What do you want to talk about?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Okay. What do you want to talk about?
:'''Clara:''' Actually, I've thought a lot about it
:'''Clara:''' I just don't understand... What is Pascal?
:'''Clara:''' Other robots think Pascal is a Fragmentum creation
:'''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog thinks Pascal is a normal robot
:'''Clara:''' Pascal doesn't even know what it is itself
:'''Clara:''' I think Pascal could even be a human
:'''Clara:''' {{MC|f=Big sister|m=Big brother}}, what do you think?
:{Choice} It is a robot...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I think Pascal is just a robot.
::'''Clara:''' You think so, {{MC|f=Big sister|m=Big brother}}?
::'''Clara:''' Pascal does look like a regular robot, but...
:{Choice} It is a Fragmentum creature...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Pascal might be a Fragmentum creature...
::'''Clara:''' You think so, {{MC|f=Big sister|m=Big brother}}?
::'''Clara:''' But doesn't Pascal just look like a normal little robot? Also...
:{Choice} It is human...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Pascal is a living human being.
::'''Clara:''' You think so, {{MC|f=Big sister|m=Big brother}}?
::'''Clara:''' I think so too, but...
:'''Clara:''' Fragmentum creature, robot, human
:'''Clara:''' What is the difference between these?
:'''Clara:''' Some Fragmentum creatures can speak and behave like humans
:'''Clara:''' While Mr. Svarog looks like a robot, he also can speak, think, and even express "emotions" like us
:'''Clara:''' So how do we tell what is "us" and what is "them?"
:{Choice} Through empathy...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Only humans have the ability to identify and empathize with other types of creatures
::'''Clara:''' So that's how it is
::'''Clara:''' So maybe, Pascal and Mr. Svarog...
::'''Clara:''' Maybe they're all living, breathing humans too
:{Choice} Through biology...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Simply put, our biological makeup is completely different
::'''Clara:''' So that's how it is
::'''Clara:''' That's probably the only way... we can draw a clear distinction between us and other things
:{Choice} There is no difference...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' There is no difference between humans and any other types of creatures in the world
::{Choice} (explain emotionally)
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' We were born in the same universe, and we are heading toward the same demise
::{Choice} (explain rationally)
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' We're all just different manifestations of the same basic particles
::'''Clara:''' So that's how it is
::'''Clara:''' It sounds complicated, but I will try and understand it
:'''Clara:''' I don't feel so lost anymore
:'''Clara:''' Thank you, {{MC|f=big sister|m=big brother}}~
:'''Clara:''' (*´ω`*)

::'''Clara:''' Okay.
::'''Clara:''' I'll try to check on Pascal first.
:{Choice} It got into trouble again!? (☉д⊙)
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It got into trouble again!? (☉д⊙)
::'''Clara:''' No! Pascal has been very good!

:'''Clara:''' (*´ω`*)
:'''Clara:''' Is it a cat? It's soooo cute. I want to pet her little head
:'''Clara:''' {{MC|f=Big sister|m=Big brother}}, if you get the chance, can you bring it over to where I am
:{Choice} Next time!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Okay. If I can... I'll definitely do it next time!
:{Choice} I'll need to ask its opinion.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Of course! But it's not a pet. It has its own will, so we'll need to check with how it feels
::'''Clara:''' &vert;ω・´) Okay
:'''Clara:''' Belobog is quite cold, so if it can come over, you should give it a few more layers of clothing, {{MC|f=big sister|m=big brother}} (*´ω`*)

:'''(Trailblazer):''' (☉д⊙)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What is it?
:'''Clara:''' A pair of shoes, and a note...

:'''Clara:''' I don't know what that is... Do you know them, {{MC|f=big sister|m=big brother}}?
:{Choice} I know them
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh, it's them. I picked up their flyers before
::'''(Trailblazer):''' They are a charity organization in the Robot Settlement. They are established to repay your kindness, Clara.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is their gift
:{Choice} I don't know, maybe just throw it away.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds sus...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Just throw it away...
::'''Clara:''' Yeah, that makes sense...
:'''Clara:''' Oh, there's something written on the back of the paper...!
:'''Clara:''' It says, "Clara, you have been caring for everyone at the Robot Settlement, so we pooled together some funds and bought a pair of shoes for you."
:'''Clara:''' "The reason being... You are always barefoot, it must be so cold for you..."
:'''Clara:''' (;´Д`)
:{Choice} (;´Д`)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (;´Д`)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' So keep it!
:'''Clara:''' Yay! I'm so happy!
:'''Clara:''' But I'm not used to wearing shoes, I keep twisting my ankle when I do... ﾟ(つд`ﾟ)
