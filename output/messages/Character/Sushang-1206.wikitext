:'''Sushang:''' (Trailblazer)
:'''Sushang:''' I finally got a hold of you
:'''Sushang:''' I hear you came to the Luofu from beyond the Alliance?
:'''Sushang:''' Can you help me
:'''Sushang:''' I'm so annoyed
:{Choice} How come
:'''(Trailblazer):''' How come
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Tell me
:'''Sushang:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|&lbrack;cry&rbrack;]]
:'''Sushang:''' I've been in the Luofu Cloud Knights for a while now
:'''Sushang:''' Aside from the daily patrols, I pretty much have done nothing
:'''Sushang:''' When will I be able to become a competent Cloud Knight?
:{Choice} You're competent enough
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Just patrol diligently and complete your daily tasks. You're competent enough
::'''Sushang:''' It's not like that. Everyone dreams of being a legend
::'''Sushang:''' I grew up listening to my mom talking about the heroes among the Cloud Knights' ranks, so it makes sense for me to dream of greatness
:{Choice} Having peace is good
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Peace is a good thing. It means your patrols are working
::'''Sushang:''' I know~
::'''Sushang:''' I grew up listening to my mom talking about the heroes among the Cloud Knights' ranks, so it makes sense for me to dream of greatness...
:{Choice} Come join the Nameless!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' If you're so keen on helping people, why don't you join the Nameless?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' There will be requests and assignments every day, it's almost impossible to finish them all
:'''Sushang:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px|&lbrack;Shocked&rbrack;]]
:'''Sushang:''' That's such a thrill!
:'''Sushang:''' I want to be a Nameless
:'''Sushang:''' What kind of requests are there? Can I have a look?
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Attachment ''Root Out the Turpitude'' has been sent
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Attachment ''Root Out the Turpitude'' has been received
:'''Sushang:''' What does turpitude mean
:'''Sushang:''' Oh, I found it
:'''Sushang:''' Why is the title of the assignment so high in gluten
:{Choice} It's highfalutin...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It's highfalutin...
:'''Sushang:''' Oh
:'''Sushang:''' Oh, is it
:'''Sushang:''' You know a lot
:'''Sushang:''' It's hard being a Nameless!

:'''Sushang:''' (Trailblazer)
:'''Sushang:''' Do you know Yanqing?
:{Choice} I've heard of him
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I have heard of his name
::'''Sushang:''' He's the golden child of the Cloud Knights
:{Choice} We've traded blows
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We traded blows a few times
::'''Sushang:''' What? You fought with the golden child of the Cloud Knights?
::'''Sushang:''' I don't believe you...
:{Choice} Who's Yanqing
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Who's Yanqing...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
::'''Sushang:''' You must know him
::'''Sushang:''' It's that kid following General Jing Yuan around
::{Choice} The general's guard?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The general's guard?
::'''Sushang:''' That's him. He's the golden child of the Cloud Knights!
:'''Sushang:''' I witnessed his sword practice today. I can't even follow his movement with my eyes! I'm so shocked
:'''Sushang:''' He's so young! How come he's already so impressive
:{Choice} Is he a prodigy
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Could he be one of those martial prodigies?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Maybe he just has the physical affinity for battle
::'''Sushang:''' That sounds right, yeah!
:{Choice} Is it because of Jing Yuan's teaching
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Could it be due to General Jing Yuan's personal coaching
::'''Sushang:''' I guess that's what it means by "standing on the shoulder of giants"
::'''Sushang:''' My mom's a Cloud Knight too, and she forced me to practice since I was young, so why am I not as good as him...?
:'''Sushang:''' But now that I've thought about it, the way he wields his sword kinda feels similar to how my mom does it
:'''Sushang:''' I should ask him for tips
:{Choice} I'm willing to accompany you!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm willing to accompany you!
:'''Sushang:''' Alright!

===What an awkward day...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Sushang:''' What an awkward day...
:'''Sushang:''' I wanted to go to the Sleepless Earl to listen to stories, and guess what.
:{Choice} What?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
:'''Sushang:''' I met my old abecedary who taught me in the lyceum!
:'''Sushang:''' I didn't know he's at the Luofu right now, what rotten luck...
:'''Sushang:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|&lbrack;cry&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} Why is it bad luck
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I thought meeting old teachers is a good thing?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why is it bad luck?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
::'''Sushang:''' Oh, wouldn't you know!
::'''Sushang:''' When I was still studying, he barely ever acknowledged me.
:{Choice} Lyceum? Abecedary?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What's a lyceum? And what's abecedary?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm an alien, I don't know these words
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
::'''Sushang:''' Oh, it's nothing. I probably don't know much more than you do anyway
::'''Sushang:''' Let me think about how to explain it to you, hold on.
::'''Sushang:''' Oh right!
::'''Sushang:''' A lyceum is a school, and an abecedary is a teacher.
:'''Sushang:''' *sigh* I really didn't want to remember that. It's so awkward.
:{Choice} Tell me
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Tell me, share the awkwardness
:'''Sushang:''' So I was raised in a military family, and my mom is very strict about me practicing my martial skills.
:'''Sushang:''' So I had to get up to spar with her before the crack of dawn, then go to the lyceum after that.
:'''Sushang:''' But by that point, I'm exhausted. I couldn't even hear anything the abecedary said without falling asleep.
:'''Sushang:''' Just now, when he saw me, he yelled, "Hey, isn't this Sleepy Sushang?"
:'''Sushang:''' Everyone on the street immediately started staring at me, I was just so embarrassed.
:'''Sushang:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|&lbrack;cry&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} It is quite embarrassing
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It is quite embarrassing
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px|&lbrack;Shocked&rbrack;]]
:'''Sushang:''' *sigh* I hope I won't run into him ever again...
