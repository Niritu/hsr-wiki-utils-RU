===I want to buy...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Misha:''' I want to buy a big storage chest
:{Choice} You've got too many things?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' You've got too many things?
:'''Misha:''' Yeah! With the exploding cloud candies that the customer gave me yesterday, my drawers are already stuffed full of souvenirs from various planets...
:'''Misha:''' I split some into smaller portions. I'll bring you some when I see you next time!
:'''Misha:''' They taste a bit like a spicier version of mint, but the aftertaste is surprisingly fresh and sweet! This flavor matches the impression I get from that customer perfectly
:'''Misha:''' He was tall and strong with a ferocious expression and a great ax on his back. He looked a lot like Boss Stone
:'''Misha:''' I spent a lot of time preparing myself mentally before going to help him...
:{Choice} Interesting contrast
:'''(Trailblazer):''' A customer like that gifting you sweets. It's got a nice contrast to it
:'''Misha:''' It does. I was super cautious when I asked if he wanted help taking his luggage up! When I realized he was the silent type, I got even more scared and actually tripped over. When I climbed back to my feet, I realized that the customer had already taken his luggage and taken the lift upstairs...
:'''Misha:''' Thankfully I didn't make any mistakes when I went to clean his room and I even fixed his Dreamscape room clock. When I went back, he was not there, but he had left a pack of exploding cloud candy for me. I breathed huge a sigh of relief... That kind of recognition felt amazing!
:'''Misha:''' Do you think... if I keep working hard like this, I'll receive enough candies from guests to cover me for the rest of my life?
:{Choice} Yes, but your teeth will rot
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Probably, but your teeth will rot! Kids should take better care of their teeth!
::'''Misha:''' I'm not a kid anymore! I may have had tooth decay before, but I've been careful ever since!
::'''Misha:''' Ah, I have to go and greet guests. Talk to you again soon!
:{Choice} Yeah! You're amazing!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah! Because you're amazing!
::'''Misha:''' Hehe, hearing you say that makes me feel so proud! It's more that the guests put up with me, though
::'''Misha:''' Thank you for your approval though. I need to go and greet guests. Talk to you again soon!

===Are you there...? Excuse...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Misha:''' Are you there...? Excuse me, I wanted to ask if there are any recommendations for things I'll need for traveling?
:{Choice} The Express has everything
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The Express has everything you need. You don't need to bring anything
::'''Misha:''' They even prepare a change of clothes? The Express really is the best!
::'''Misha:''' Although, hearing you say that makes me worry even more... Ah, what else do I need to take with me?
:{Choice} Phone, credits, a baseball bat...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Phone, credits, a baseball bat! They're all pretty practical, right?
::'''Misha:''' Yeah! Communications, currency, and an item for self-defense... are all absolute necessities!
::'''Misha:''' But these things aside, what else will I need...
:'''Misha:''' I finally got a short amount of vacation time, but I haven't even decided where I want to travel to!
:'''Misha:''' I want to prepare my luggage, then select my destination. Then, I can just set off right away!
:{Choice} Would you like to come with us?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Would you like to come with us? We'll leave tomorrow!
::'''Misha:''' That's very tempting, but I only have three days... I don't think that's very suitable for long-distance travel
:{Choice} You could vacation in the hotel
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You could actually spend your holiday in the hotel
::'''Misha:''' That's a really good idea... I may have worked here for a long time, but I've never enjoyed the hotel's services as a guest before!
::'''Misha:''' I just know there are lots of exciting things to explore. Just thinking about it makes me so happy!!!
:{Choice} Are you not scared traveling alone?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Are you not scared traveling alone? What if you run into bad people?
::'''Misha:''' I'm not scared! I decided I am going to learn from you, (Trailblazer)! I'm going to buy a baseball bat to protect myself!
:{Choice} Remember to send pictures
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Remember to send me pictures
:'''(Trailblazer):''' No matter where you are, pictures can always bring us closer together
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Message Misha 40.png|256px]]
:'''Misha:''' ...A solitary and frozen land... do these Snow Plains have a name? What planet are they on? Can you visit without an invitation?
:{Choice} You can go whenever you like
:'''(Trailblazer):''' These Snow Plains are on the planet Jarilo-VI, outside the town of Belobog. You are free to go whenever you like
:'''Misha:''' Great. I have to go and see this place!
:'''Misha:''' Speaking with you makes me so happy! It feels like I've already started on my dream adventure. You have to tell me more next time!

:'''Misha:''' It's getting closer...
:'''Misha:''' There's a huge shadow in the hotel...
:{Choice} Where are you? I'll head over
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Where are you? I'll head over to you
::'''Misha:''' I'm in the hotel corridor...
::'''Misha:''' There's a huge shadow... It's getting closer
:{Choice} Run!!!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Run!!!
::'''Misha:''' I want to... But my legs have gone weak. I can't move...
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Misha has gone offline
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Misha is online
:'''Misha:''' I was saved... I ran into the elevator and came down when it turned to go in a different direction
:'''Misha:''' Thank you. Your message comforted me a lot
:{Choice} I'm just glad you're okay
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm just glad you're okay. Tell me more about this shadow
::'''Misha:''' I actually don't know much about it... I've heard before that there's a black shadow haunting the hotel at night, sometimes crying, sometimes laughing...
::'''Misha:''' Ah, what bad luck... At least I managed to get away! I heard that one of my brave co-workers came across it last night and then...
::{Choice} ...Are they still alive?
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' And then... Are they still alive?
:::'''Misha:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px]]
:::'''Misha:''' They are! It's just that when the shadow passed them, all of the lights in the corridor suddenly went out! Before they did... he saw a grimacing shadow...
::{Choice} Did they beat up the shadow?
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Did they give the shadow a good beating?
:::'''Misha:''' My colleague was getting ready for a fight, but all of the lights in the corridor suddenly went out! Before they did... he saw a grimacing shadow...
:{Choice} I've seen it before, too
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No need to thank me, I've seen it before, too
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Actually, it is not (Trailblazer) that is speaking with you now, it is me...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You never would have guessed, would you? I have already devoured your friend...
::'''Misha:''' ...
::'''Misha:''' Is this real?
::{Choice} Of course it isn't!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' *cough* It's a joke! Of course it's not real!
::{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Misha has gone offline
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Misha...? Hello? Helloooo?
::{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Misha is online
::'''Misha:''' You scared me silly! I'm so glad you're okay! I was just looking for a way to rescue you!
:'''Misha:''' Wait! A grimacing shadow... Crying... It's back...
:'''Misha:''' I'll use my broom as a baseball bat... It should work just as well, right?
:'''Misha:''' I'm going in!
:{Choice} You can do it!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' You can do it!
