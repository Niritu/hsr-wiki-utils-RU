:{Choice} That's not me!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's not me. I didn't do anything. What are you accusing me of?

:{Choice} Where did you see that?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' ?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait, how did you know that? Where did you see that?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' How come I didn't see you???

:'''Moze:''' (Trailblazer).
:'''Moze:''' Where is the Astral Express' front door?
:'''Moze:''' I mean, how do I get inside the Express?
:{Choice} Have you quit your job?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Have you quit your job?
:{Choice} Is this a robbery?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why? You want to rob the Express?
:'''Moze:''' No. I am on holiday.
:'''Moze:''' The general has ordered me to rest.
:{Choice} Rest on the Express?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You want to rest on our Express?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You can get a pretty good sleep on the Express, that's true
::'''Moze:''' I am not going in order to sleep.
:{Choice} General Feixiao is so kind!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' General Feixiao is so kind!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I wish the Express conductor would order me to get some rest too
::'''Moze:''' Is she? If you say so.
::'''Moze:''' This was an order. I must follow it.
:'''Moze:''' I hear that the Astral Express travels all over the universe.
:'''Moze:''' I am certain that it will need a cleaner.
:{Choice} Cleaner???
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Cleaner? Who? You?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is your idea of rest? Doing housework?
::'''Moze:''' Yes.
::'''Moze:''' Cleaning and eradicating dirt relaxes me and brings me joy.
::{Choice} Come on over then
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Come right over then. We definitely need the cleaning!
:{Choice} But that's Pom-Pom's job
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're trying to steal our conductor's job?
::'''Moze:''' Your Express conductor can take a rest.
::'''Moze:''' Fear not. Cleaning and eradicating dirt relaxes me and brings me joy.
::'''Moze:''' In my eyes, that is rest.
::{Choice} Come on over then
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Then come on over. I know Pom-Pom would welcome you happily
:'''Moze:''' Okay.
:'''Moze:''' I was going to go over there anyway.
:'''Moze:''' Jiaoqiu told me to go in from the front entrance.
:'''Moze:''' However, that is not my normal style.
:'''Moze:''' Therefore, I decided to ask you first in the interest of courtesy.
:'''Moze:''' Thank you.

===Have you ever tried...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Moze:''' Have you ever tried to assassinate your superior on the Astral Express before?
:{Choice} Who is my superior?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Who is my superior?
::'''Moze:''' I don't know.
::{Choice} We are a flat organization
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We are a flat organization
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We have a conductor, but no leader
::'''Moze:''' Oh.
:{Choice} Assassinate!?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Assassinate!? Why would I assassinate the conductor?
::'''Moze:''' For a challenge.
::'''Moze:''' Fine.
:'''Moze:''' It seems that you have a very simple relationship between you.
:'''Moze:''' That is unlike my work. Here, we have grudges, debts of gratitude, superiors and juniors, and lunch friends.
:{Choice} That's too complicated
:'''(Trailblazer):''' That's too complicated
:'''(Trailblazer):''' The less I know, the better
:'''Moze:''' Regarding vengeance, General Feixiao allows me to challenge her at any time I please.
:'''Moze:''' I have attempted sneak attacks, traps, and public duels, but they have all failed.
:'''Moze:''' If you have no experience, I can report that back.
:{Choice} Report it back?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Report it back?
:'''Moze:''' Report back to General Feixiao that you have no experience with assassinating your superiors.
:'''Moze:''' I failed to assassinate the general again today. The general suggested that I speak to others and try to come up with new ideas.
:{Choice} That's bold!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's a bold suggestion! I have to respect her
:{Choice} That's crazy!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's crazy! Why would you accept that suggestion?
:'''Moze:''' I think that studying is always a good idea.
:'''Moze:''' However, assassination techniques are all about expertise, not quantity.
:'''Moze:''' Even if I received your advice, I would need to perfect it myself.
:'''Moze:''' Thank you for your response. I shall ask someone else.
