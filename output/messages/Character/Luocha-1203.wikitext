===Hey, (Trailblazer)===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Luocha:''' Hey, (Trailblazer)
:'''Luocha:''' Sorry to disturb you, but there's something I forgot to ask
:'''Luocha:''' Like I said before, the journey of a traveling merchant is mostly drawn-out and boring
:'''Luocha:''' Do you have any advice for passing time when traveling, (Trailblazer)?
:{Choice} Chat with people
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Chat with the people around you
::'''Luocha:''' To be honest, I'm not great at opening a conversation... But with that coffin around me, a conversation is bound to happen
:{Choice} Do whatever you like
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Do whatever pleases you. Play games, read books, watch the scenery, anything you want
::'''Luocha:''' Finish the books I've borrowed on the Luofu, this might not be a bad idea
:{Choice} Sleep the whole way
::'''(Trailblazer):''' There's really nothing to do on the road except sleeping
::'''Luocha:''' The purpose is the end point, not the process, huh?
:'''Luocha:''' Is that what you've been doing in your journeys, (Trailblazer)?
:{Choice} Of course
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Of course, that's what I do all the time
::'''Luocha:''' Sounds like you've got some insights
::'''Luocha:''' Thank you for giving me a sincere suggestion
:{Choice} Of course not
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Of course not, I never do that
::'''Luocha:''' Sounds like you chose something that you think suits me best
:'''Luocha:''' I'll try it

===(Trailblazer), when you came...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Luocha:''' (Trailblazer), when you came to the Luofu, where did you stay? How was it?
:'''Luocha:''' Wait, lemme guess
:'''Luocha:''' Petrichor Inn?
:{Choice} It's not bad
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's right, I did stay at the Petrichor Inn
::'''(Trailblazer):''' A premium suite, it's not bad
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
::'''Luocha:''' The premium suite is not easy to book, most people would just go there for the Starwatcher Avenue's night view
:{Choice} It's so-so
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's right, I did stay at the Petrichor Inn
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But honestly, it's nothing to write home about
::'''(Trailblazer):''' After all, every time I stay in a hotel, I worry about bad things happening, so I've got no time to think about other stuff
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|&lbrack;cry&rbrack;]]
::'''Luocha:''' Sounds like you've been through some rough patch
:'''Luocha:''' I stay at the Petrichor Inn often. After all, it's easy to get anywhere from there
:'''Luocha:''' As a traveling merchant, I don't indulge much in my trips, but even so, I get bored after a while
:'''Luocha:''' There are some units in the Skyward Pavilions neighborhood that allow short-term rentals, so I went there
:'''Luocha:''' That's where Xianzhou residents usually stay
:{Choice} Sounds like you are being watched.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds like it's not that convenient and that you are being watched somehow.
::'''Luocha:''' That depends on how you see it
::'''Luocha:''' Life on the Xianzhou is not that shut-in. People are friendly, so experiencing and observing their way of life is my hobby...
::'''Luocha:''' But that's not quite right. Most of the time, I'm the one being observed.
:{Choice} So, you're like a Xianzhou resident now?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Looks like you've become a Xianzhou resident yourself now
::'''Luocha:''' Heh heh, you know me
::'''Luocha:''' Yeah, with that, I've blended with the populace on the Luofu
:'''Luocha:''' I'm nomadic and have nowhere to call my home. Staying in the Skyward Pavilions neighborhood even for a while helps me forget my identity as a traveling merchant
:'''Luocha:''' So, I quite like it
:{Choice} I'll try too
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I shall try it too, next time
::'''Luocha:''' Alright, maybe we can be neighbors if we're lucky
:{Choice} I probably can't
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I probably can't stay there
::'''Luocha:''' Can I ask the reason?
::{Choice} I'm scared!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm scared!
::{Choice} I'm not used to another bed!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm not used to another bed!
::{Choice} I'm a clean freak!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm a clean freak!
::'''Luocha:''' I see
::'''Luocha:''' I understand, and I respect your decision
::'''Luocha:''' If you change your mind some day, we'll talk

===(Trailblazer), I couldn't sleep last night===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Luocha:''' (Trailblazer), I couldn't sleep last night
:'''Luocha:''' Maybe I'm too naive. Without returning customers, it's hard to do business at night
:'''Luocha:''' I went to the Aurum Alley, it's an old street famous for its night bazaar
:'''Luocha:''' As a traveling merchant, how can I not check it out?
:{Choice} You were selling?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You were selling?
::'''Luocha:''' Yes and no, buying and selling are always reciprocal that way
::'''Luocha:''' I do have some uncommon trinkets with me, but it's not like I can meet someone who likes them every time
::'''Luocha:''' That being said, people on the Xianzhou are friendly. Even if they don't buy things, they'll still chit-chat with me
:{Choice} You were buying?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You were buying?
::'''Luocha:''' Yes and no, buying and selling are always reciprocal that way
::'''Luocha:''' Many shops do have some interesting thingamabobs with them, but it's not like everything would suit my taste at a given time
::'''Luocha:''' That being said, people on the Xianzhou are friendly. Even if I don't buy things, they'll still chit-chat with me
:'''Luocha:''' I just didn't think the chatting will last until shops start to close up
:'''Luocha:''' I did have a fun night, but thinking back, what exactly did I gain?
:{Choice} You gained intel!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't put it like that
::'''(Trailblazer):''' At least you gained hot info of Xianzhou's industries!
::'''Luocha:''' Haha, looks like I'm truly a traveling merchant in your eyes
:{Choice} At least you gained friendship!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't put it like that
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You gained the friendship of Xianzhou people!
::'''Luocha:''' That's right, is there anything more precious than that?
:{Choice} You gained eyebags!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't put it like that
::'''(Trailblazer):''' At least you got yourself a pair of eye bags!
::'''Luocha:''' A shame, I'm the type of person who doesn't show even if I stayed up all night
:'''Luocha:''' If you have a chance, you should check out the Aurum Alley
:'''Luocha:''' And if I'm still here on Xianzhou, call me along
