:'''Gepard:''' (Trailblazer), we're preparing to set off
:'''Gepard:''' Let's meet at the Overworld cable car in a bit
:{Choice} Alright, I'll be right there
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Okay, be right there.
:{Choice} So sudden?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So sudden?
:'''Gepard:''' It's not urgent. I still have to head back to the military lines first
:'''Gepard:''' I'm guessing Serval just left home. If you arrive before us, you'll have to wait for a while
:'''Gepard:''' Anyways, see you later

===(Trailblazer), thank you for...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Gepard:''' (Trailblazer), thank you for your Express drinks.
:'''Gepard:''' Especially the bottled soda. It tastes great.
:'''Gepard:''' I'd like to thank you on behalf of the other Guards as well!
:'''Gepard:''' Actually, are there any Belobogian drinks you'd like?
:{Choice} Jim Roger
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Jim Roger's drinks &mdash; the taste of bread for the price of water
::'''Gepard:''' Its advert is probably more memorable than its taste.
::'''Gepard:''' It just tastes like bread anyways.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' True
::'''Gepard:''' I'll get you more next time.
:{Choice} Moo-Moo Milk
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Moo-Moo Milk, full of flavor
::'''Gepard:''' That reminds me of how Serval used to force me to drink milk every day when I was a kid...
::'''Gepard:''' Their cheese and sour cream are not bad either. I'll get you some next time.
:{Choice} Rye Bread Soda Iceberg
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Rye Bread Soda Iceberg. Everyone's talking about it
::'''Gepard:''' It's the Goethe Hotel's star beverage, after all.
::'''Gepard:''' You know you can actually make Rye Bread Soda Icebergs yourself? It's pretty simple.
::'''Gepard:''' We can try to make it together next time.

===(Trailblazer), there's something I'd...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Gepard:''' (Trailblazer), there's something I'd like to discuss with you.
:'''Gepard:''' Do you have time?
:{Choice} I do, what is it?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I do, what is it?
:'''Gepard:''' Actually, my youngest sister just came home from a scientific expedition.
:'''Gepard:''' I want to gift her something, what do you think is a suitable gift?
:{Choice} What does she like?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What does she like?
::'''Gepard:''' I feel bad for saying this, but I'm not quite sure what she likes.
::'''Gepard:''' I only know that she's very passionate about science and outdoor expeditions.
::'''Gepard:''' Oh, I have an idea. What if I gift her a new set of scientific expedition gear?
::{Choice} [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's not a bad idea
::'''(Trailblazer):''' As long as she likes it
::'''Gepard:''' You're right. Thank you for helping me sort out my thoughts.
::'''Gepard:''' I'm going ahead to look for gifts. See you soon.
:{Choice} Get her some flowers
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You can buy her some flowers
::'''Gepard:''' I thought about gifting her flowers, but I remember her saying she's not interested in run-of-the-mill plants.
::'''Gepard:''' She likes the ones in the Snow Plains, those that are rare in the city.
::'''Gepard:''' I have an idea. Next time I'm patrolling the Snow Plains, I'll keep an eye on anything interesting.
::{Choice} [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's not a bad idea
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But be safe
::'''Gepard:''' Haha, I will, thank you.
::'''Gepard:''' I'll make myself busy now, see you soon.
:{Choice} Buy her some new clothes
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You can buy her some new clothes
::'''Gepard:''' I thought about that, but I don't have good taste when it comes to fashion, so I dared not make a choice.
::'''Gepard:''' Serval did buy her some really nice clothes.
::'''Gepard:''' But I don't want Serval to know.
::{Choice} [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 04.png|80px|&lbrack;Decline&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 04.png|80px|&lbrack;Decline&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why so shy?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're family, just go and ask
::'''Gepard:''' ...
::'''Gepard:''' You're right, I should just ask Serval just to avoid buying the wrong things.
::'''Gepard:''' Thank you for your suggestion, I'll look for Serval now, see you.

===(Trailblazer), are you there?===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Gepard:''' (Trailblazer), are you there?
:'''Gepard:''' I want to ask something about the security in Belobog.
:{Choice} What happened?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What happened?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
:'''Gepard:''' We received a report recently saying a vehicle fired a chainsaw into the Qlipoth Fort and shattered a window. They think it's an attack.
:'''Gepard:''' Have you heard any news about this?
:{Choice} I have no idea
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I have no idea
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Who would it be?
::'''Gepard:''' ...
::'''Gepard:''' No worries, I think I have an idea of whom the perpetrator is.
::'''Gepard:''' I'm sorry to have bothered you. I'll go ahead and ask the workshop.
:{Choice} Not me
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's not me! I swear!
::'''Gepard:''' ...
::'''Gepard:''' Don't worry, I know you wouldn't do things like this.
::'''Gepard:''' Actually, I think I know who incited it...
::'''Gepard:''' I'm sorry to have bothered you. I'll go ahead and ask the workshop.
:{Choice} Could it be...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Only that person would mod their cars to that degree
::'''Gepard:''' Serval?
::{Choice} I said nothing
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I have said nothing...
::'''Gepard:''' ...
::'''Gepard:''' How should I put it...
::'''Gepard:''' That's what my intuition tells me...
::'''Gepard:''' Regardless, I will ask her about it. Thank you for the idea.
::{Choice} I really said nothing
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I have really said nothing at all...
