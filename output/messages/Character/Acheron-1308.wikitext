:'''Acheron:''' This is my contact info
:{Choice} Hello!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Hello!
::'''Acheron:''' Hello
::'''Acheron:''' It's been a while since I heard such a normal greeting, it's really comforting
:{Choice} I'm surprised
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's totally unexpected
::'''Acheron:''' Haha, really?
::'''Acheron:''' Well, discovering the "unknown" is also the essence of journeys
:'''Acheron:''' Before coming to Penacony, I thought it would be just a regular trip
:'''Acheron:''' To fulfill a dead man's wish and take him back to a place he could never return to
:'''Acheron:''' But before I knew it, this world became so vibrant and colorful
:'''Acheron:''' And I've become a part of it
:{Choice} You played a crucial role!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You played a crucial role!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 03.png|80px]]
::'''Acheron:''' Oh, it was nothing, really
::'''Acheron:''' It's all thanks to you, Nameless, and the other Pathstriders
:{Choice} I'm a part of it too!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm a part of it too!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 12 Other 03.png|80px]]
::'''Acheron:''' Exactly
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 12 Other 03.png|80px]]
:'''Acheron:''' As this journey comes to an end, let's wake up and embrace tomorrow
:'''Acheron:''' May we all appreciate the beauty of the world on a larger vista

===Are you a gourmet, (Trailblazer)?===

:'''Acheron:''' Are you a gourmet, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Warning}} <Grand Melodie Golden Hour>
:'''Acheron:''' Earlier, I helped this lady in Penacony without realizing she's actually a chef at a fancy restaurant. This is her restaurant
:'''Acheron:''' She'll be launching a special menu with a "peach" theme soon, and I highly recommend it
:{Choice} I'm definitely giving it a shot!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm definitely giving it a shot!
:{Choice} Aren't you coming?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Aren't you coming?
::'''Acheron:''' I've already tried it
:{Choice} Sounds "avant-garde"...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds "avant-garde," maybe something on the dark side of the cooking...
::'''Acheron:''' Dark side...? Does that mean there is a light side of the cooking as well?
:'''Acheron:''' Cooking... well, it brings back memories. I used to love it
:'''Acheron:''' However, it's hard to enjoy dishes when you can't really taste anything
:{Choice} Do you still cook now?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Do you still cook now?
:{Choice} Is this caused by the Nihility?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is this caused by the Nihility?
::'''Acheron:''' Perhaps
:'''Acheron:''' Sometimes, I still cook up some food, but it's a shame that I can't taste much anymore
:'''Acheron:''' Still, there are some workarounds. For example, you can make ice cream out of snow
:'''Acheron:''' It's cool, moist, and creamy... a flavor that I'll never forget
:'''Acheron:''' I'll treat you to it when I get the chance
:'''Acheron:''' And don't forget to try the peach dishes too

===Oh, by the way,...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Acheron:''' Oh, by the way, I came across something cute recently
:'''Acheron:''' As I was passing by the COLORS store, the store clerk asked for my autograph
:{Choice} You're famous now!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Well, you're totally a celebrity now with everything you've done!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px]]
::'''Acheron:''' It was all a misunderstanding
:{Choice} Was it a misunderstanding or...?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Was it a misunderstanding or something...?
::'''Acheron:''' Yes
:{Choice} Your autograph? I want one too!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Your autograph? I want one too!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 03.png|80px]]
::'''Acheron:''' It was all a misunderstanding
:'''Acheron:''' Miss Robin's makeup in the COLORS ad "Mien of Vesper" bears a resemblance to the attire of young girls from my hometown, leaving even me momentarily lost in nostalgia
:'''Acheron:''' And now that I think about it, I miss how those girls would worry about their makeup getting ruined in frequent thunderstorms
:'''Acheron:''' Oh, speaking of COLORS, I found some awesome products there, so I bought them as a small token of my appreciation
:'''Acheron:''' I think Miss Himeko will love this rose-colored lipstick
:'''Acheron:''' And this "Spring Scenery" eyeshadow will be perfect for Miss March
:'''Acheron:''' Not only that, they have some hydrating and cleansing products that people are raving about
:{Choice} Thanks!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Thank you! I'll spread the word!
::'''Acheron:''' You're welcome.
:{Choice} Didn't expect you to know about makeup
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Didn't expect you to know so much about makeup
::'''Acheron:''' Took you by surprise, huh?
:'''Acheron:''' I'll mail them to you before I forget
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend is offline
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend is online
:'''Acheron:''' Oh, sorry
:'''Acheron:''' By the way, do you know where the post office is?
:{Choice} I knew it...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I knew it...
:{Choice} Do you need my help?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Do you need my help?
:'''Acheron:''' Oh, found it
:'''Acheron:''' It's right behind me
