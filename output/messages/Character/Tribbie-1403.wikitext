:'''Tribbie:''' Little Gray, are you free right now?
:{Choice} A combat request?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What is it? Are we busting monsters or people?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' 30% discount for you
:{Choice} Yep, on my way.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How did you know I'm about to grow mold from boredom?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Just send me a word. I'll teleport over there immediately
:'''Tribbie:''' No rush, just a little favor we'd like to ask
:'''Tribbie:''' When we woke up today, our favorite book was gone. We couldn't find it anywhere
:'''Tribbie:''' Trianne is about to cry
:'''Tribbie:''' Trianne did not!
:'''Tribbie:''' Oh me, oh my, at this point, we'll have to find a diviner to help
:{Choice} Aren't you girls diviners?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I thought you know how to do that?
:'''Tribbie:''' It's not the same. Different Fate Titans bring different prophecies
:'''Tribbie:''' There's a super-duper-mega-ultra powerful diviner in Okhema called Pasithea. Allegedly, she can tell the future just by dreaming
:'''Tribbie:''' However, due to some past circumstances, it's not advisable that we meet her...
:'''Tribbie:''' So
:'''Tribbie:''' Little Gray, please!
:'''Tribbie:''' Pleeeeease!!!
:'''Tribbie:''' Please~
:'''Tribbie:''' All three of us said please, so you must go, okay?

:{Choice} Of course
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Have no fear when I'm on the job
:'''(Trailblazer):''' But I'm currently dealing with something urgent
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Give me some time, and I'll get to the bottom of it when I'm back
:'''Tribbie:''' We don't know what you're facing
:'''Tribbie:''' But keep it up, Little Gray!

:{Choice} Lift your pillow
:'''(Trailblazer):''' She asks you to lift your pillow
:'''(Trailblazer):''' And that's it
:'''Tribbie:''' It can't possibly be there
:'''Tribbie:''' We've looked for it high and low
:'''Tribbie:''' AH
:'''Tribbie:''' Found it!!!
