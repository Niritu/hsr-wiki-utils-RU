::'''Lynx:''' I'm worried he's competing at the moment
::'''Lynx:''' I don't want to interrupt him
::'''Lynx:''' It's safer to message you
::'''Lynx:''' It's about Igor
:{Choice} Alright, but why?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Okay, no problem. But why does he need to go to the Divination Commission?
::'''Lynx:''' It's about Igor
::'''Lynx:''' Can you let him know?
:'''Lynx:''' The Divination Commission said that the jade pendant we brought them...
:'''Lynx:''' Is actually a jade abacus. You should know what that is
:'''Lynx:''' It contains Igor's records
:'''Lynx:''' I think Luka would definitely be interested
