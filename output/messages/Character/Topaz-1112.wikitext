:'''Topaz:''' (Trailblazer), I received a proposal for the Engine of Creation
:'''Topaz:''' It says you were part of the drafting team, do you know anything about it?
:{Choice} Yes
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh yeah, I did that
::'''Topaz:''' I can tell you're proud of it
:{Choice} I don't know
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Idk, never heard of it. Don't ask me
::'''Topaz:''' Is that so? I'll delete it
:'''Topaz:''' I took a look at the proposal, I think...
:'''Topaz:''' It's pretty good. The ideas are great, and it is very feasible. 7 out of 10
:'''Topaz:''' Please relay the message, and ask them to continue working according to the proposal

:{Choice} Yes
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh yeah, I did that
::'''Topaz:''' ...You're quite smug about it
:{Choice} I don't know
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Idk, never heard of it. Don't ask me
::'''Topaz:''' Right, thank goodness you had nothing to do with it.
:'''Topaz:''' I took a look at the proposal, I think...
:'''Topaz:''' It's a little ridiculous. I find it hard to comprehend the mental state of the person who drafted it.
:'''Topaz:''' Please relay the message to them and tell them to learn more and think harder. I've already dispatched employees to provide guidance

===It can't be...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Topaz:''' It can't be...
:'''Topaz:''' This shouldn't have happened...
:{Choice} What happened?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What happened?
:{Choice} *sigh sigh sigh*
::'''(Trailblazer):''' *sigh sigh sigh*
::'''Topaz:''' Why are you sighing?
:'''Topaz:''' Some stocks I hold have tanked, which is a bit unusual
:'''Topaz:''' Things were looking up with quite a few new planets joining the cosmic market, so the stocks should've been on the rise, but how come they suddenly took a nosedive by seven percentage points?
:'''Topaz:''' Could it be the work of the Marketing Development Department? Doesn't seem like it. Those folks have the skills, maybe just a tad too zealous.
:{Choice} Huge loss?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Were your losses significant?
:'''Topaz:''' Oh nothing, just some disposable income
:'''Topaz:''' Losses and wins are normal. I'm just analyzing the reason it happened
:{Choice} It must be Nanook!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It must be Nanook!
::'''Topaz:''' The Antimatter Legion? THEY are indeed a focal point of the IPC's attention
::'''Topaz:''' Oh right, the effects of the Stellaron also cannot be ignored. A reasonable direction for speculation.
:{Choice} It must be the Astral Express!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Maybe it's because the Express trailblazed the star rail, causing the market to go bear...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We from the Astral Express are so impactful!
::'''Topaz:''' Oh? Does that mean my losses can be reimbursed by you?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px]]
::'''Topaz:''' Hahah, just kidding
::'''Topaz:''' Buuuut... The effects of the Stellaron do need to be taken into account.
:'''Topaz:''' Thanks. Even though it's not a professional analysis, it does give me something to think about
:'''Topaz:''' I'll continue with my work now~

===The project is equipped...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Topaz:''' The project is equipped with a massive protective barrier that can withstand even planetary impacts. It operates as a self-contained ecosystem, fulfilling the survival needs of entire Amber Eras. Under the IPC's protection, almost no external forces can affect this facility. Without a doubt, it's the safest sanctuary in the cosmos.
:{Choice} Another hacked account?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why do people keep getting hacked?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' All these weird messages...
::'''Topaz:''' This is a proposal I'm doing for a project
::'''Topaz:''' Interested?
:{Choice} How much? I'm in
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How much to invest? Count me in!
::'''Topaz:''' Aye, someone's being decisive!
::'''Topaz:''' This is a proposal I'm doing for a project
::'''Topaz:''' I knew you'd be interested
:{Choice} Do you not need rest?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Do you not rest?
:'''Topaz:''' I *am* resting. Making proposals is relaxing for me
:'''Topaz:''' Do you like your work?
:{Choice} Love it
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I love it. I can't even eat properly if I don't work
::'''Topaz:''' That's right. I knew you'd understand
::'''Topaz:''' You've gained a few more points in my eyes
:{Choice} I don't like it
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't like it. Just thinking about work gives me a full-body migraine
::'''Topaz:''' Is it? That's unfortunate
::'''Topaz:''' If everyone could find purpose in life in their work, wouldn't it be nice?
:{Choice} I don't have a job
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't have a job
::'''Topaz:''' Aren't you a Nameless?
::{Choice} The Express doesn't pay me a salary
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' The Express doesn't pay me a salary
::{Choice} I work for love!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I work for love!
::'''Topaz:''' I see...
::'''Topaz:''' Looks like you've also gone past the stage of working just for money
::'''Topaz:''' You've gained a few more points in my eyes

===(Trailblazer), are you there?===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Topaz:''' (Trailblazer), are you there?
:'''Topaz:''' I'm mulling something over, mind if I pick your brain?
:{Choice} [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px]]
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px]]
:'''Topaz:''' Do you...
:'''Topaz:''' want to be my colleague?
:{Choice} [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px]]
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px]]
:'''Topaz:''' Based on my observation, you've got some serious potential to join the Strategic Investment Department
:'''Topaz:''' The scale of our operations here at the IPC speaks for itself. With your skills, you could easily climb up to rank P20 with just a few missions under your belt.
:'''Topaz:''' If I were to put in a good word for you, becoming a branch manager in 10 years is not impossible for you!
:'''Topaz:''' Give it a think?
:{Choice} What are the work meal options on-site?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What are the work meal options on-site?
::'''Topaz:''' You should ask what's not available. Order whatever you want, and the system will have it covered. It's like a one-stop shop, they'll cater to all your cravings.
::'''Topaz:''' Wanna try?
::{Choice} Even if I'm not an employee?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Even if I'm not an employee?
:{Choice} I'm loyal to the Astral Express
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No one can poach me
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I am loyal to the Astral Express!
::'''Topaz:''' Really? That's a shame
::'''Topaz:''' But Miss Himeko does seem like a cool boss, I bet it's a blast working with her.
::'''Topaz:''' Let's grab a meal another time, consider it relationship maintenance.
::{Choice} Are you sure?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Are you sure? Sounds like it's gonna be expensive...
:'''Topaz:''' No worries. Put it on my tab
:{Choice} Any other perks for me?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Are there any other perks for me?
:'''Topaz:''' Of course, for example... you can bring your own pets to the office!
:'''Topaz:''' I have so many little critters, and they're all super~ duper~ cute!
:'''Topaz:''' As long as you become an employee of the IPC, they can be with you every day. Isn't that great?
:{Choice} We have our conductor
:'''(Trailblazer):''' We have our conductor
:'''(Trailblazer):''' How about you jump ship over to the Astral Express instead?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px]]
:'''Topaz:''' Oh dear, am I being reverse-poached?
:'''Topaz:''' Don't worry. I'll be visiting the Express plenty
:'''Topaz:''' I will definitely give Pom-Pom a good scritch~
