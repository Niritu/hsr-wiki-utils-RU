:'''Luka:''' Hey!
:'''Luka:''' (Trailblazer)!
:'''Luka:''' I'm Luka!
:'''Luka:''' I heard from Oleg that you fought in the Fight Club too?
:'''Luka:''' Are you free tonight? Come and watch my match
:{Choice} No problem
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No problem. I'll be there
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 05.png|80px|&lbrack;Okay&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} I'm busy
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm busy. I can't make it sorry
::'''Luka:''' What about tomorrow?
::'''Luka:''' The day after tomorrow is fine too!
::'''Luka:''' I'll be fighting every day anyway!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ...I'll come over when I have the time
:'''Luka:''' That's a promise!
:'''Luka:''' One thing tho... Something weird's happening lately in my matches
:'''Luka:''' I kept going against fully-armed vagrants and automatons
:'''Luka:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px|&lbrack;Shocked&rbrack;]]
:'''Luka:''' Can someone with weapons and missiles really count as a Fight Club fighter!?
:{Choice} Times have changed
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Times have changed, and so the Fight Club has to keep up
::'''Luka:''' Hmm, that's reasonable!
::'''Luka:''' Honestly, I also want to mod my robot arm to fire missiles
::'''Luka:''' But that just feels like I'm moving away from the original vision of the Fight Club...
:{Choice} It's diluting the Fight Club
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Fighting with weapons goes against everything the Fight Club stands for
::'''(Trailblazer):''' A fighter should rely on one's own strength!
::'''Luka:''' Exactly!!!
::'''Luka:''' But then again... My robot arm is made of metal...
:'''Luka:''' I give up, no use overthinking it
:'''Luka:''' No matter how the opponent chooses to fight, I will win!
:{Choice} You can do it!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' You can do it!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
:'''Luka:''' Just remember to cheer for me!

::'''Luka:''' Are you serious?
::'''Luka:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 04.png|80px|&lbrack;Decline&rbrack;]]
