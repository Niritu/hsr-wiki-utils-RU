:'''Rappa:''' Two!
:'''Rappa:''' Four!!
:'''Rappa:''' Six!!!
:'''Rappa:''' {{tx|Missing sticker}}{{subst:void|<!--SpriteOutput/Emoji/118007.png-->}}
:'''Rappa:''' Baseball Bat Ninja! I actually see six live escaped fiendlings!
:{Choice} You're still in Penacony?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're still in Penacony?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Hang on, why are there still monkeys!
:{Choice} They're still here, bana!?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why have they not been exterminated, bana!?
:'''Rappa:''' Has this place also been infiltrated by the poisonous dreamscape? Let me go and take a closer look!
:'''Rappa:''' There are even ignorant people lingering by its side, taking photos together. This makes it hard for me to launch a direct attack.
:'''Rappa:''' {{tx|Missing sticker}}{{subst:void|<!--SpriteOutput/Emoji/118001.png-->}}
:'''Rappa:''' By the Great Lan above...
:'''Rappa:''' I can't believe I met the Most Awesome Ninja in the World
:'''Rappa:''' No no, it's a bunch of the Most Awesome Ninja in the World!
:{Choice} What happened?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What happened?
:{Choice} You aren't the best ninja?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What? "Baseball Bat Ninja, turns out you're not number one in the world"?
:'''Rappa:''' You may not be privy to this, but according to the ''Ninja Mind Dojo'' scrolls' records, the Most Awesome Ninja in the World once slew an ancient mechanical leviathan the size of a star
:'''Rappa:''' A pity the First Ninja has passed. I will always remember that ninja's heroism...
:'''Rappa:''' But I really couldn't fathom how the best in the world would be cut down in the middle by some random Evil Ninja
:'''Rappa:''' Today, I have finally understood
:'''Rappa:''' The Most Awesome Ninja in the World faked their own death, and ended up at this place called...
:'''Rappa:''' F•E•S's spatial memory zone!
:{Choice} So you are at the comic fest!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' F•E•S? So you are at the comic fest?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Then don't trouble the little monkey any longer
:'''(Trailblazer):''' They're real people! Real people!
:'''Rappa:''' I know that the Most Awesome Ninja in the World is prolific at the Ninja Bunshin Specter arts
:'''Rappa:''' But almost everyone here knows the Ninja Bunshin Specter arts!
:'''Rappa:''' It's no wonder I can feel the overflow of energy brimming from this place
:'''Rappa:''' By the Great Lan above!
:'''Rappa:''' Even Headpat Villager Elder is here!
:'''Rappa:''' I've always wanted to learn ninjutsu from him!
:'''Rappa:''' There's even Talk No Jutsu Ninja here!
:'''Rappa:''' And Cloak Curse Ninjutsu!
:'''Rappa:''' With so many renowned Ninja Heroes present, the six monkeys must be in a fluster
:'''Rappa:''' Worry not, Baseball Bat Ninja, I shall seek guidance from the various elders first!

{{Messages|text=
:'''Rappa:''' Baseball Bat Ninja! My apologies
:'''Rappa:''' I have roamed the stars, and seen many wonders

:'''Rappa:''' How would one chant the ninja mantra that can destroy all worlds?
:{Choice} Rival to Nanook!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' "Destroy" all worlds, rival to Nanook!

:'''Rappa:''' Humble in victory, gracious in defeat

:'''Rappa:''' The necklace was indeed given to my hands, but Tutor Ninja kept it again, following other plans
:'''Rappa:''' Could I have had the chance to the final's advance?
:'''Rappa:''' Alas, the ninja mantra riddle leaves before me a darkness dance

===Hey! Baseball Bat Ninja!===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Rappa:''' Hey! Baseball Bat Ninja!
:'''Rappa:''' You may have plenty of ningu that can thwart all manner of evil
:'''Rappa:''' But do you suffer from a lack of a method that allows the swift swapping of weapons?
:'''Rappa:''' I have a newly crafted ningu that I sincerely invite all ninja to try
:{Choice} Woah, you're a tinkerer?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I never took you for a tinkerer!
::'''Rappa:''' Worry not, my ningu are personally crafted, and present no risk in use.
:{Choice} Baseball Bat Ninja incoming!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Baseball Bat Ninja incoming!
:'''Rappa:''' When traveling the worlds, a ninja must use one's eyes to observe the surroundings &mdash; body, tool, word, and will must all exist as one
:'''Rappa:''' Ningu should also be forged by ninja arts, channeled with ninja spirit, and wielded with ninjutsu
:'''Rappa:''' Your Rulebreaker Anthem left a deep impression
:'''Rappa:''' The inspirational spark came to me in the deep night
:{Choice} Rulebreaker Anthem?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The Rulebreaker Anthem? You mean, "Rules are meant to be broken"?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why am I getting this sinking feeling
:{Choice} Why am I getting this sinking feeling
::'''(Trailblazer):''' "Rules are meant to be broken?"
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is an ominous sign
:'''Rappa:''' The Baseball Bat Spray Gun
:'''Rappa:''' Multi-Purpose Ningu!
:'''Rappa:''' A trigger is hidden in the bat, just flip open the formal hat-shaped scope cap
:'''Rappa:''' Ninja Ceremonial Mirror!
:'''Rappa:''' Peer into the mirror to see brilliant ribbons and hologram clock immersed in the battle's rhythms
:'''Rappa:''' Ninja Fantasia!
:'''Rappa:''' The tip of the bat is carved into a flame-shaped hollow, the colorful liquid within splashed into a rainbow to follow
:'''Rappa:''' Ninja Flaming Splendor!
:'''Rappa:''' A single swing of this fire lance of a bat, and blazing ninja talismans will ignite just like that!
:{Choice} Let the show begin!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Now that we've got the vibe all hyped up, ensemble cast, begin!
:{Choice} NOW I can fight eight!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I can fight eight guys with this!
:'''Rappa:''' Combining your anthem, I have also specially made a voice-activated trigger
:'''Rappa:''' Aim it at an enemy ninja, yell out the special anthem, and call upon the spray!
:'''Rappa:''' Rebounder Ninjutsu: Starry Trailblaze, Firewind Orchestra: Cosmic Hunter
:'''Rappa:''' Baseball Bat Ninja, you can try shouting to see if you can flaunt greater ninja grandeur
