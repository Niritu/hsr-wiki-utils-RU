{{Messages|text=
:'''Bronya:''' (Trailblazer), have you ever felt that...
:'''Bronya:''' Everyone around is afraid of you and is reluctant to tell you the truth
:{Choice} I have never been a leader...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I have never been a leader
::'''Bronya:''' Sorry, I just don't know who else to ask
:{Choice} You need to learn to fit in
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You need to learn to fit in
::'''Bronya:''' I know, but it's hard to actually do it
:'''Bronya:''' My mother said the life of a Guardian is doomed to be lonely
:'''Bronya:''' I guess I need some more time to adapt
:'''Bronya:''' I also talked to Seele, but she looked at me, bewildered, and said she couldn't understand what those people were thinking
:{Choice} Seele is different because she is not afraid of you?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is it possible that...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Seele is different because she is not afraid of you?
::'''Bronya:''' Is that so...
::'''Bronya:''' Now I think about it, Seele really is not afraid of anyone
:{Choice} How dare she!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How dare she do this to you!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You are the Supreme Guardian
::'''Bronya:''' You mean she is not afraid of me?
::'''Bronya:''' I think you are right
:'''Bronya:''' Maybe I can find my own path as a leader...
:'''Bronya:''' I'll do my best!
