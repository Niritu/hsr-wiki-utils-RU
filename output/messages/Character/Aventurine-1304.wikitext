:{Choice} We'll collaborate.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' We've decided to accept your request for collaboration
:'''Aventurine:''' Wonderful. Your response came faster than I expected
:'''Aventurine:''' From now on, we'll all be in this together
:'''Aventurine:''' Here's a small something for our upcoming partnership
:{{DIcon|Warning}} You have received 100,000 credits
:{Choice} Thanks, boss.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wow wee
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's so generous of you, boss. Thanks!
:{Choice} That's a LOTTA money!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Bro, you should be more prudent with your money
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But I'll take them all just this one time.
:{Choice} That's it?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's it?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That doesn't seem like much. Gimme another 100k, rich boy. Lemme see what you've got
:'''Aventurine:''' Oops. I pressed send too early
:'''Aventurine:''' Here's a little extra just for good luck with this new gig
:{{DIcon|Warning}} You have received 100,000 credits
:'''Aventurine:''' Just as I anticipated, The Family is going to sweep Robin's case under the rug for as long as they can. So, her case is only a secret between us
:'''Aventurine:''' But the other case... that depends on what excuses they have prepared for you guys
:'''Aventurine:''' I'll take my leave for now. And I look forward to an outstanding performance from you guys!

===Sorry, I only just...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Aventurine:''' Sorry, I only just saw your message
:'''Aventurine:''' Now that my mission on Penacony has come to an end, I can finally use my phone in the open
:'''Aventurine:''' It felt like I was in jail
:{Choice} I'm glad you're okay
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Glad to see you're safe and sound
::'''Aventurine:''' Haha, you're so kind
:{Choice} Where have you been?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Where have you been?
::'''Aventurine:''' Long story. Let's save it for next time
:{Choice} Rest in peace
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Rest in peace! Guess it's over at last
::'''Aventurine:''' Haha, this sounds more like you!
:'''Aventurine:''' Since we've got nothing else going on, how about we play a simple dice game to keep our senses sharp?
:'''Aventurine:''' If the number you roll is greater than or equal to mine, I'll tell you something that happened after the theme park incident
:{Choice} Sounds good. Let's begin!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds good. Let's begin!
::'''Aventurine:''' Let's do it
::{{DIcon|Warning}} [Aventurine] rolls a 3.
::'''Aventurine:''' Your turn. Your chances seem good
::{Choice} Casually roll the die
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Doesn't matter to me anyway
:::{{DIcon|Warning}} [(Trailblazer)] rolls a 2.
:::'''Aventurine:''' How about one more round? Nothing in the rules says we can't have a do-over
:::{Choice} Roll again
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Let's do it again then
:::{{DIcon|Warning}} [(Trailblazer)] rolls a 6.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Spill it
:::'''Aventurine:''' How lucky
::{Choice} Aggressively roll the die
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Give me a big one!
:::{{DIcon|Warning}} [(Trailblazer)] rolls a 4.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Mine's bigger, now spill it
::'''Aventurine:''' After taking that one strike from that Emanator's blade, I waded into a river wider than any I've seen in my life
::'''Aventurine:''' I thought I had reached the end of my life
::'''Aventurine:''' But... as you can see, I'm still alive, and I'm happy about that
::{{DIcon|Warning}} [Aventurine] rolls a 1.
::'''Aventurine:''' Your turn
::{Choice} Casually roll the die
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I think I'm in luck
:::{{DIcon|Warning}} [(Trailblazer)] rolls a 5.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' ...And?
::{Choice} Aggressively roll the die
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is surely a win, right?
:::{{DIcon|Warning}} [(Trailblazer)] rolls a 6.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' What happened next?
::'''Aventurine:''' When you guys were unraveling the secrets beneath the Penacony's surface, I already fell into the Primordial Dreamscape. The Preservation's Cornerstone shielded me from the contamination of the Nihility, but in doing so, it completely shattered to smithereens.
::'''Aventurine:''' Fortunately, I met a Knight of Beauty and narrowly escaped death with his help.
::{{DIcon|Warning}} [Aventurine] rolls a 1.
::'''Aventurine:''' It's your turn. We gotta follow through with this game
::{Choice} Casually roll the die
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Easy-peasy
:::{{DIcon|Warning}} [(Trailblazer)] rolls a 2.
:::'''Aventurine:''' Luck is on your side
::{Choice} Aggressively roll the die
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' What happened after that?
:::{{DIcon|Warning}} [(Trailblazer)] rolls a 6.
:::'''Aventurine:''' You're doing great, my friend
::'''Aventurine:''' Then, thanks to you lot, all the truths came to light. Topaz and Jade took over the affairs on Penacony, and now I get to enjoy some time off
::'''Aventurine:''' But I've been having various nightmares these past few days, waking up drenched in sweat every single time
::'''Aventurine:''' Thankfully, the IPC has arranged for a Doctor of Chaos to give me a thorough examination, and things have improved
::'''Aventurine:''' That's about it. You're really lucky to get me to tell the whole story
::{Choice} Are you losing on purpose?
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I knew you were losing on purpose from the get-go. There's no way you're that unlucky
::{Choice} Enjoy losing much?
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Happy losing, huh? You've tricked me again
::'''Aventurine:''' The Dreamscape may be a bustling place, but there aren't many 'friends'. I gotta find ways to make do, wouldn't you say?
::'''Aventurine:''' Thanks for helping me through the tough times. Hope I wasn't a bother
:{Choice} I'll pass
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll pass
::'''Aventurine:''' Oh, that's too bad, I thought you'd like it.
::'''Aventurine:''' Never mind, it's not that important anyway
:'''Aventurine:''' Guess I'll find fun somewhere else, see ya

===Hey, friend. How's life...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Aventurine:''' Hey, friend. How's life treating you lately?
:'''Aventurine:''' There's a new store that opened up on Penacony &mdash; Cosmic Star. I'm checking the place out
:'''Aventurine:''' Lots of fun stuff here
:{Choice} Oh? You getting me something?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh? Are you getting me something?
::'''Aventurine:''' First, let's see if there's something that tickles your fancy
::'''Aventurine:''' Cosmic Star houses treasures from all over the universe. Every item is crafted by top-notch designers
::'''Aventurine:''' Most importantly, the items are of excellent quality and made of fine materials. They are nothing like the luxury goods that are all show and no substance
::'''Aventurine:''' For example, this "Horizon" series pajama is made with a material so light it feels like nothing, warm in winter, cool in summer, and extremely comfortable
::'''Aventurine:''' Wearing it to sleep should considerably lessen the fatigue from travel
::'''Aventurine:''' Take, for another example, these "Night Diamond" series gloves, the last masterpiece by the deceased design master Van Jagh. They're handcrafted and limited to ninety pairs galaxy-wide, perfect for parties and special occasions.
::'''Aventurine:''' Of course, they are highly recommended for long-distance trips too. They are gorgeous and are sure to turn heads!
::'''Aventurine:''' And then there's this windbreaker from the "Unmanned Flight" series &mdash; a timeless classic!
::'''Aventurine:''' You can wear it and stand on the edge of a cliff, listening to the flapping of its hem when the cosmic storm hits... It's because of that scene in the movie, "Unmanned Flight" has now become the go-to choice for a generation of the Nameless and their followers.
::'''Aventurine:''' Which one do you like?
::'''Aventurine:''' I'm heading to the checkout now, so I'll pick up your stuff and pay together
::{Choice} Choose one
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll choose one then
:::{Choice} Pajamas
::::'''(Trailblazer):''' The "Horizon" pajamas then
::::'''Aventurine:''' Done
::::'''Aventurine:''' I'll have them deliver it to you
::::'''Aventurine:''' In the long cosmic nights, may your every dream be sweet and fancy
:::{Choice} Gloves
::::'''(Trailblazer):''' The "Night Diamond" gloves then
::::'''Aventurine:''' Done
::::'''Aventurine:''' I'll have them deliver it to you
::::'''Aventurine:''' I hope they make everyone envious of you
:::{Choice} Windbreaker
::::'''(Trailblazer):''' The "Unmanned Flight" windbreaker then
::::'''Aventurine:''' Done
::::'''Aventurine:''' I'll have them deliver it to you
::::'''Aventurine:''' I'm sure you'll look cool in it. Remember to take a picture for me!
::{Choice} I want them all
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I want them all
:::'''Aventurine:''' Cool! That's what friends are for!
:::'''Aventurine:''' All done
:::'''Aventurine:''' They will all come in handy during your many travels
::{Choice} Nah, not interested in any of them
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' No thanks. I'm not interested in any of them
:::'''Aventurine:''' What a pity... but I've already bought them all
:::'''Aventurine:''' If you change your mind, just let me know anytime
:{Choice} Not interested, bye
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Are they related to me? They aren't my cup of tea at all
::'''Aventurine:''' I see
::'''Aventurine:''' We can do some shopping here together next time. It's going to be a blast!
::'''Aventurine:''' I'll get out of your hair for now
::'''Aventurine:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 03.png|80px]]
