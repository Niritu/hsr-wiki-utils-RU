:'''Yanqing:''' (Trailblazer)! I saw the Sky-Faring Commission's notice that the Express has docked on the Xianzhou
:'''Yanqing:''' Are you guys on the Luofu already?
:{Choice} Just got to Starskiff Haven!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yup, fresh off the train. We're now at Starskiff Haven
:{Choice} Quick with the news, eh?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I see you're quick with the news!
:'''Yanqing:''' Heh, the general sent me to welcome you all at Starskiff Haven. See you in a bit!

:'''Yanqing:''' (Trailblazer), do you have time to chat?
:{Choice} Chat away
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm quite free right now. Chat away
::'''Yanqing:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 03 Yanqing 02.png|80px]]
::'''Yanqing:''' Great! Thanks
:{Choice} If it's not too long
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We can chat if it's not too long
::'''Yanqing:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 03 Yanqing 02.png|80px]]
::'''Yanqing:''' It won't be
:'''Yanqing:''' I don't know if it's because of the pressure of the Wardance ceremony or something else
:'''Yanqing:''' I keep dreaming about dueling different opponents
:'''Yanqing:''' ...I don't remember much about the dreams, but... I think I lost so many times
:{Choice} You poor child
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Poor child, you lost even in dreams?
::'''Yanqing:''' I don't really care about the wins and losses in dreams
:{Choice} This is probably stress
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is a manifestation of being overwhelmed by stress
::'''Yanqing:''' I see
:{Choice} I recommend having sweet dreams
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yanqing, you know about Penacony, right? Go there and dream some sweet dreams about beating your opponents
::'''Yanqing:''' I don't think that dreaming about "defeating someone in the dream" is necessarily good...
::'''Yanqing:''' But thanks for the tip, (Trailblazer)
:'''Yanqing:''' Even though I was dreaming, the opponents each time were different
:'''Yanqing:''' I remember there was a spear trial, an épée trial, a greatsword trial, a glaive trial... I even fought myself once
:'''Yanqing:''' But no matter which trial it was, I keep feeling it had the vaguest of connections with you, (Trailblazer)
:'''Yanqing:''' It's like you brought these opponents to face me...
:{Choice} Looking to avenge yourself?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What do you mean? Are you looking to avenge yourself?
::'''Yanqing:''' No, no
::'''Yanqing:''' That's not what I meant!
:{Choice} Yeah, it was all me
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I admit, I sent all the opponents you faced while dreaming
::'''Yanqing:''' (Trailblazer), you're such a joker
::'''Yanqing:''' It was just some hazy dreams that I had
:{Choice} I don't have that kind of power
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I... don't think I'm capable of influencing other people's dreams yet
::'''Yanqing:''' I don't think this is something you did, (Trailblazer)
::'''Yanqing:''' It was just some hazy dreams that I had
:'''Yanqing:''' "That which one thinks about during the day is what one dream about at night"
:'''Yanqing:''' These dreams must be a projection of my desire to spar with you, (Trailblazer)
:'''Yanqing:''' So, I'm thinking... Can you...
:{Choice} I'll give you some guidance
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I completely understand now. You want me to come and give you some guidance
::'''Yanqing:''' Exactly
::'''Yanqing:''' If you have the time, please enlighten me
:{Choice} Wait until you've improved
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't be too hasty. When you think you've had some improvement, we can always try again
::'''Yanqing:''' I understand
:'''Yanqing:''' It feels so much better to say what's on my mind. Thank you. I shall bother you another day
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Sure. Talk next time

===(Trailblazer), can I bother...===

:'''Yanqing:''' (Trailblazer), can I bother you with something?
:'''Yanqing:''' Not sure if you're available now?
:{Choice} I'm free
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm free. What's up?
::'''Yanqing:''' That's great!
:{Choice} It might not be the best time...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It might not be the best time, is it urgent?
::'''Yanqing:''' It's not urgent. I will keep it short
:{Choice} ...Did March cause trouble?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Lemme guess, did March 7th cause trouble again?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Let's be clear, I'm not March's parent
::'''(Trailblazer):''' If there's an issue, please look for Mr. Yang, Himeko, or even Dan Heng
::'''Yanqing:''' Don't worry, Miss March is okay. It's just that I have some matters I need to trouble you with
:'''Yanqing:''' The Wardance had its ups and downs, but ultimately it ended smoothly
:{Choice} Too many ups and downs...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's not just "ups and downs," it's straight up a roller-coaster
::'''Yanqing:''' You're right, (Trailblazer), this Wardance has had too many incidents
:{Choice} You're generalizing too much...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're speaking in generalities and omitted the most important part: the Wardance
::'''Yanqing:''' ...But the issue at hand is not about the Wardance, so allow me to skip that topic
:'''Yanqing:''' Although there were many bumps along the way, luckily we had the aid of the Express Crew. I express my sincere thanks to you and the Crew
:'''Yanqing:''' However, merely sending a message to express gratitude is not considered proper etiquette
:'''Yanqing:''' I hope to be able to meet the Express Crew one more time and personally see everyone off
:{Choice} Sounds good
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Of course. Where should we meet?
::'''Yanqing:''' That's great, Miss March and Dan Heng have also agreed to meet
:{Choice} What did the others say?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What did March and Dan Heng say?
::'''Yanqing:''' They've all agreed
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Then I'll certainly join
:'''Yanqing:''' Then, we shall meet at the Starskiff Haven. I look forward to seeing you there
:{Choice} See you there
::'''(Trailblazer):''' See you there
:{Choice} I might be a bit late...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I might be a bit late, ahahaha...

===[Greet]===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Yanqing:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 01.png|80px|&lbrack;Greet&rbrack;]]
:'''Yanqing:''' Hi, Teacher (Trailblazer)!
:'''Yanqing:''' The general said you travel all over the place
:'''Yanqing:''' I spotted two new swords from the Artisanship Commission
:'''Yanqing:''' The choices are overwhelming and I don't know which to pick
:'''Yanqing:''' Can you help take a look and give some comments?
:{Choice} Sure
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Sure, what do they look like?
:'''Yanqing:''' One of them is of Vidyadhara make, forged with the exotic corallium metal of Scalegorge Waterscape and tempered with thaumaspring water. Such a blade can be easily wielded even in extreme conditions.
:'''Yanqing:''' It's a masterpiece!
:'''Yanqing:''' The other one is Shadeslink Sword, forged by the Furnace Master himself using an outworld crystal jade. Its luster is compelling, and it's fitted with the newest flight component. It can be connected with the wielder's consciousness and sent flying across the battlefield
:'''Yanqing:''' It's so cool!
:{Choice} The first one
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Get the first one
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Function trumps form when it comes to battling with all kinds of abominations and monsters
:{Choice} The second one
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Buy the second one
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Coolness lasts for a lifetime!
:{Choice} Get both
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Only children have to make a choice
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Just get both!
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Yanqing has gone offline
:{Choice} ?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Yanqing has come online
:'''Yanqing:''' Bought!
:'''Yanqing:''' I don't care. I'll deal with whatever happens at the end of the month!
:{Choice} Just don't care!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Just don't care!
:'''Yanqing:''' You can admire it a little when we meet!
:'''Yanqing:''' Thank you for the advice, (Trailblazer)!

:'''Yanqing:''' (Trailblazer)
:'''Yanqing:''' I'm a little curious
:'''Yanqing:''' In your journeys, have you ever met opponents who left lasting impressions on you?
:{Choice} Doomsday Beast
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I defeated the Antimatter Legion's Doomsday Beast at the Herta Space Station
::'''Yanqing:''' Doomsday Beast? I may have read about it in one of the Cloud Knight martial almanacs, but I don't remember exactly...
::'''Yanqing:''' After all, Xianzhou has not clashed with the Antimatter Legion for a long time
::{Choice} Imagine a huge lizard
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Just imagine a huge lizard with wings
::'''Yanqing:''' I see, I think I get it...
::'''Yanqing:''' I'm jealous of you, there are so many monsters to sharpen sword skills with outside of the Xianzhou
:{Choice} Gepard
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I've combated a very strong martial captain in Jarilo-VI
::'''Yanqing:''' Martial captain? What's that?
::{Choice} Imagine a Cloud Knight Commander
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's similar to the Commander of the Cloud Knights on the Luofu
::'''(Trailblazer):''' His punches were as hard as a glacier, and his weapon was unconventional, a shield made out of an instrument case
::'''Yanqing:''' Instrument case!
::'''Yanqing:''' Indeed, in the hands of the powerful, even a blade of grass or a stick of branch can be used as a weapon
::'''Yanqing:''' What a fun opponent, I would like to have a match with him!
:{Choice} Not as strong as me
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Indeed, but they were all defeated by me!
::'''Yanqing:''' Haha, you are truly someone respectable! I hope I can meet with you on the stage of the Luminary Wardance ceremony
::'''Yanqing:''' However, I will definitely take the title of Sword Champion when that time comes!
:'''Yanqing:''' The general thinks my swordsmanship can still be improved, so I will continue to train hard
:'''Yanqing:''' If you have time, do you mind having a few bouts of matches with me?
:'''Yanqing:''' I shall take my leave, see you!

===(Trailblazer), SOS!===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Yanqing:''' (Trailblazer), SOS!
:'''Yanqing:''' It's raining and I saw a litter of white kittens without their mom, what should I do?
:{Choice} Wait for their mom
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Maybe wait for their mom to return? She could've been out to hunt food
::'''Yanqing:''' I thought so too, so I've been holding an oil-paper umbrella for them
::'''Yanqing:''' I don't dare to move them, it would be bad if their mom came back and couldn't find them
:{Choice} Move them under shelter
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Move them somewhere with cover, they'll get sick at this rate
::'''Yanqing:''' I don't dare to move them, it would be bad if their mom came back and couldn't find them
::'''Yanqing:''' Luckily, I bought a paper umbrella, I can keep them under it for a while
:{Choice} Become a cat dad
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Take them home and become a cat dad
::'''Yanqing:''' I'll wait for their mom to return, she could've gone away to hunt food. It would be bad if she can't find the kitten when she comes back
::'''Yanqing:''' Luckily, I bought a paper umbrella, I can keep them under it for a while
:'''Yanqing:''' Looking at them *sigh*...
:{Choice} Something the matter?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Something the matter?
:'''Yanqing:''' I just thought how I never saw my birth parents. I don't even know if they didn't want me, or if they're already gone...
:'''Yanqing:''' But then again, I don't have many memories anyway, so... I'm okay
:'''Yanqing:''' My earliest memory is the general teaching me
:{Choice} Must be difficult
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It must have been difficult for you
::'''Yanqing:''' I'm okay, the general had it harder, I think
:{Choice} He has his work cut out for him
::'''(Trailblazer):''' He has his work cut out for him
::'''Yanqing:''' Yeah, he must've put in so much effort
:'''Yanqing:''' Oh, cat mommy is back
:{Choice} That's good!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' That's good!
:'''Yanqing:''' I'm going now, thank you for listening
:'''Yanqing:''' Remember to keep it a secret! I'm a big boy now, so no pinkie swears are needed
