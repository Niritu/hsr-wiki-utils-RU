:'''(Trailblazer):''' Mr. Yang, are you there? Mr. Yaaaang~
:'''Welt:''' I have been here the entire time. What's the matter, (Trailblazer)?
:{Choice} Does the Express welcome new members?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Does our Express welcome new members?
::'''Welt:''' Oh? I'd, of course, welcome them
:{Choice} I have a friend who wants to join...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I have a friend who wants to board the Express. What do you think, Mr. Yang?
::'''Welt:''' Oh? Making friends here is always a wonderful thing. I welcome any addition of new members
:'''Welt:''' However, do you mind if I ask some questions?
:'''Welt:''' I'm curious. What kind of friend did you make, (Trailblazer)?
:{Choice} She's meticulous...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' She's a mechanical prodigy with a meticulous mind
::'''Welt:''' I suppose that means she will have a lot in common with Himeko. That's not bad
:{Choice} She's uninhibited...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' She's a rock star with an uninhibited personality
::'''Welt:''' Oh? That's a pretty good hobby. I myself am interested as well
:{Choice} I can't say...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' She's... I can't say for sure
::'''Welt:''' It matters not. I trust your judgment of character, it shouldn't be too far off
:'''Welt:''' Anyhow, I would like to welcome your friend
:'''Welt:''' However, I'm not the decision maker here, but I will put in a good word for you with Himeko
:'''Welt:''' In my experience, she shouldn't have much objection. So don't worry
:{Choice} Thank you, Mr. Yang
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Thank you, Mr. Yang
:{Choice} Hooray! Thanks, Mr. Yang!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Hooray! Thanks, Mr. Yang!
:'''Welt:''' No need to thank me. It's the least I can do

===(Trailblazer), are you there?===

:'''Welt:''' (Trailblazer), are you there?
:'''Welt:''' I have a question for you.<br />Did March, Dan Heng, and you see anything extraordinary in the mountains north of Belobog?
:{Choice} We saw the Engine of Creation
::'''(Trailblazer):''' There was a giant robot called the Engine of Creation
::'''Welt:''' That might be what we are looking for. It would be good if I can witness it with my own eyes.<br />Maybe it's possible to get it re-activated
::'''Welt:''' If possible, I would like to drive it around...
::'''Welt:''' I'm sorry. I went off on a tangent
:{Choice} We saw a device to imprison the Stellaron
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I recall that there was a device to imprison the Stellaron
::'''Welt:''' The Stellaron is indeed capable of releasing unusual electromagnetic waves. Maybe that is what we are looking for
:{Choice} We saw March 8th
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I think I saw lots of March 8ths
::'''Welt:''' March 8th?
::'''Welt:''' Oh. Dan Heng may have indeed mentioned this in the records. It's the Antimatter Legion frozen in the Eternal Freeze, right?<br />It is indeed extraordinary, but probably not what we are looking for
:'''Welt:''' After the blizzard on Jarilo-VI weakened, Himeko and I detected an unidentified signal there but were unable to decipher its contents
:'''Welt:''' Considering the fact that this planet has just gone through the crisis of Stellaron and is still not stable yet, it would be troubling if this signal were to attract malicious parties to this location.<br />Would you kindly go have a look when you've got the chance?
:{Choice} No problem
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No problem. I'll go have a look.
::'''Welt:''' Thank you. Himeko and I will have some rewards ready for you once you get back
:{Choice} Any rewards?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's so far and so much hassle. Will Mr. Yang and Himeko at least offer me some modest benefits?
::'''Welt:''' Hahaha, don't worry.<br />Himeko and I will get some rewards ready by the time you return
:'''Welt:''' I have sent the rough coordinates of the signal to you. Thank you for your trouble

===The initial results are...===

:'''Welt:''' The initial results are back. This entity born out of space distortions is called a Calyx
:'''Welt:''' Such entities may contain reality data that has practical value. Exercise extreme caution when you come into contact with it. The very nature of spatial distortion is inexplicable chaos, and it's quite difficult to tell if there are any elements of danger hidden within

:'''Welt:''' Hmm, the spawns from this one are of a different species. The materials they produce are actually worth a lot of money

:{Choice} What do we have here?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What do we have here?
:'''Welt:''' This type of Calyx is very sought-after. It exudes a substance that can stabilize Light Cones
:'''Welt:''' If you find anything curious during your adventure, show it to me. The things you've found so far are all very interesting...

:{Choice} Found another new Calyx mutation
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Mr. Yang, is this also a Calyx?
:'''Welt:''' Yes. Remember, I mentioned that there are many different kinds of Calyxes, and the reality data stored in them may vary
:'''Welt:''' Remember to be thoroughly prepared before you make physical contact with them. It's not gonna be worth it if you get yourself hurt out of avarice

:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Message Welt Stagnant Shadow.png|256px]]
:{Choice} What is this, Mr. Yang?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What is this, Mr. Yang?
:'''Welt:''' Stagnant Shadows are entities that have been influenced by Fragmentum energy and are confined within static space-time
:'''Welt:''' Once external forces get involved, the space-time within the Shadows will start to flow again, meaning the imprisoned creature or monster may regain activity
:'''Welt:''' I wouldn't recommend anyone to make contact with the Shadows unless they are genuinely interested in certain priceless relics captured by the Shadows. Just be careful, (Trailblazer)

:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Message Welt 3.png|256px]]
:{Choice} What is this, Mr. Yang?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What is this, Mr. Yang?
:'''Welt:''' It appears to be a rift in space, torn open by the Fragmentum as it erodes reality. The scientific name for this phenomenon is "Cavern of Corrosion"
:'''Welt:''' No one knows for sure what kind of space the Caverns are connected to. However, research does indicate that valuable reality data is often scattered within these Caverns
:'''Welt:''' As with the Calyxes, the derivatives of the Fragmentum always carry unidentified risks. Please exercise extra caution if you wish to explore further

:'''Welt:''' [Laugh]
:'''Welt:''' And we do so without taking any credit.

:'''Welt:''' "Dreamlight" Mixed Sweets? That's an interesting name. The Commercial District sells snacks like this?
:{Choice} It's for you, Mr. Yang
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It's for you, Mr. Yang. Thanks for all you've done
:'''Welt:''' Well, if that's the case, I'd like to thank you all too. Adventuring together has been a real treat for me as well.
:'''Welt:''' I hope our trailblazing expedition never ends.
:{Choice} Remember to have a taste
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It's said these candies have a unique design. You should have a taste
:'''Welt:''' Alright. I'll give it a try.
:'''Welt:''' It's got a very interesting flavor. Are these all ingrained with memoria?
:'''Welt:''' If I can apply these techniques to the creation of animations, then it'll definitely be more...

:{Choice} What is this, Mr. Yang?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What is this, Mr. Yang?
:'''Welt:''' It is a Calyx, a strange entity born from the phenomenon of space distortion.
:'''Welt:''' There are some reality data in the Calyxes that might come in handy, but please be careful when coming in contact with them. The existence of these Calyxes is still a mystery to us, and the danger within is incalculable.
:'''Welt:''' In your coming journey, you might come across other Calyxes like this, and the reality data stored in different Calyxes may vary, so look out for that.

{{Messages|text=
:'''Welt:''' (Trailblazer), do you have a moment? I have a favor to ask.
:{Choice} Okay Mr. Yang, let's hear it
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Okay Mr. Yang, let's hear it
:'''Welt:''' Do you know how to change your profile picture?
:{Choice} I don't know either
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't know either
::'''Welt:''' If (Trailblazer) doesn't know, then I doubt anyone does.
:{Choice} Maybe try asking Customer Service
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Maybe try asking Customer Service
::'''Welt:''' Ah, I can't find the Customer Service function either.
:'''Welt:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|&lbrack;cry&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} What do you want to change your profile picture to?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What do you want to change your profile picture to, Mr. Yang?
:{Choice} Are profile pictures important?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is changing your profile picture important?
::'''Welt:''' Absolutely! And extraordinarily so to me.
:'''Welt:''' [[File:Message Welt Animation.png|256px]]
:'''Welt:''' This is the earliest version of the animation.
:'''Welt:''' Although the calendar here is different from that of my hometown, I have calculated that the anniversary of the premiere of Arahato is coming up soon.
:'''Welt:''' I did so many takes to get my new profile picture ready for the anniversary, but I never imagined that...
:'''Welt:''' It's time for the Express to have its own internal communication app.
:{Choice} Indeed

===It's another new day today, (Trailblazer).===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Welt:''' It's another new day today, (Trailblazer).
:'''Welt:''' When we step on the Express and follow in the footsteps of the Nameless, it means that we will become accustomed to things that are not of the ordinary.
:'''Welt:''' You will push beyond your limits without even realizing it.
:'''Welt:''' (Trailblazer), have you experienced anything like that before?
:{Choice} I have suddenly started receiving a huge volume of messages.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Indeed, I have suddenly started receiving a huge volume of messages
::'''Welt:''' Messages represent the connection between people.
::'''Welt:''' If you receive messages every day, it means that the connection between you and others has deepened during your Trailblaze journey.
::'''Welt:''' But connections also need to be maintained. Take care to manage your time wisely.
:{Choice} I have suddenly started receiving many new assignments.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Indeed, I have suddenly started receiving many new assignments
::'''Welt:''' You can't count yourself as worthy of the Nameless if you can't handle several assignments at the same time.
::'''Welt:''' Plan your route efficiently so that you won't run around the same circle twice. Otherwise, you're just doing extra work.
::'''Welt:''' Before you know it, you'll have already developed the muscle memory for it.
;(All choices lead to the following options)
:{Choice} Sounds like you're a seasoned veteran
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds like you're a seasoned veteran, Mr. Yang!
::'''Welt:''' The experience of the Nameless is but a lesson of sweat and blood.
::'''Welt:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 05.png|80px|&lbrack;Okay&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} Such is the price of following Trailblaze
::'''(Trailblazer):''' If this is the price of following Trailblaze, I'm willing to pay it!
::'''Welt:''' To have attained such enlightenment at such a young age.

===(Trailblazer), I just got...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Welt:''' (Trailblazer), I just got a great idea!
:'''Welt:''' We can make an animation based on the Express!
:{Choice} [Shocked]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px|&lbrack;Shocked&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} [Thumbs Up]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} [Decline]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 04.png|80px|&lbrack;Decline&rbrack;]]
::'''Welt:''' Hear me out on this one.
:'''Welt:''' Of course, the story would take place in the distant past.
:'''Welt:''' And for obvious, practical reasons, we will most likely need to modify most of the plot in the end... but that's just an afterthought.
:'''Welt:''' I've been out of the industry for a long time now, and frankly, I'm especially interested in hearing what you young people think.
:'''Welt:''' For example, what would you find most compelling in such a story?
:{Choice} An adventure with ups and downs
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It should be an adventure with ups and downs
::'''Welt:''' Unique settings and a collision of destinies &mdash; can't do without either of those.
:{Choice} A thrilling, relentless battle
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It should be a thrilling, relentless battle
::'''Welt:''' Companions who have each other's backs, and powerful enemies &mdash; can't do without either of those.
:{Choice} I want to see the protagonist fully upgrade their equipment
::'''(Trailblazer):''' In truth, I just want to see the protagonist fully upgrade their equipment
::'''Welt:''' That is, the protagonist keeps getting upgrades and getting stronger, right?
:'''Welt:''' Next question: When do you think this story should end?
:{Choice} I hope it never ends
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I hope it never ends
::'''Welt:''' Maybe you could serialize it? That sort of thing has been done before.
:{Choice} When everyone's wishes come true
::'''(Trailblazer):''' When everyone's wishes come true
::'''Welt:''' After reaching a satisfying conclusion... stories like that have been told before in animation.
:{Choice} When everyone's equipment is fully upgraded
::'''(Trailblazer):''' When everyone's equipment is fully upgraded
::'''Welt:''' If the story is forced to continue after everyone's equipment has been fully upgraded, the battles may become unbalanced.
:'''Welt:''' I'm actually really glad that you see our journey that way.
:'''Welt:''' Looks like I'll have to make this dream come true after my next retirement...
:'''Welt:''' (Trailblazer), wait until that time comes, and then we'll have a nice chat again.
