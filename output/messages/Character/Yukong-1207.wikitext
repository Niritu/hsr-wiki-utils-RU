===I hope it's ok...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Yukong:''' I hope it's ok to ask, (Trailblazer)
:'''Yukong:''' Do you actually like what you do? Does it align with your dreams?
:{Choice} Similar
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Pretty similar, I quite like my situation right now
:{Choice} Not the same
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Not quite what I thought it would be, but it's not bad
:{Choice} Can't remember
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't know, I can't remember it that well
:'''Yukong:''' Honestly, I never considered not working as a pilot
:'''Yukong:''' If my dad saw me now, he might yell at me for being a coward who ran away from the battlefield
:{Choice} The job market is a battlefield
::'''(Trailblazer):''' A desk job is also a battlefield, it mustn't have been easy to reach this point
:{Choice} It's your choice to make
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Your life, your choice. As long as it fulfills you
:'''Yukong:''' Yeah... I'm different from dad...
:'''Yukong:''' I just have one wish for my child...
:'''Yukong:''' It doesn't matter if she's unexceptional, I just hope she's safe and sound
:{Choice} I have no kids. Can't relate.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't have a child, I wouldn't know...
::'''Yukong:''' That's right, maybe talking to you about this is a little too soon
::'''Yukong:''' You're still young, after all
:{Choice} Your children should have a say
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I can understand a parent's wishes, but your children should have a say too
::'''Yukong:''' They're still young, after all
:'''Yukong:''' Some things can only be understood through experience just like I did
:'''Yukong:''' So many years have passed...

===I haven't been here...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Yukong:''' I haven't been here for so long
:'''Yukong:''' Untouched places are few and far between on the Luofu...
:{Choice} Where are you?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Where are you?
:{Choice} Pics or it didn't happen!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Pics or it didn't happen!
:'''Yukong:''' I'm on top of the Jade Gate
:{Choice} You can get on the Jade Gate?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You can actually get on the Jade Gate?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
::'''Yukong:''' Of course, I did that a lot when I was young
:{Choice} How do you get down from there?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Problem is, how do you even get down from there?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
::'''Yukong:''' Naturally, if I can get on it, I can get off it
:'''Yukong:''' I finally got yesterday's workload done, so I'm taking a break
:'''Yukong:''' I was going to send you a photo, but the signal's acting funny
:'''Yukong:''' Even text messages are coming in slower than usual
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Yukong has gone offline
:{Choice} Next time I'll check it out myself
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll check it out myself next time, I wanna see it with my own eyes
:{Choice} It's fine that texts are not going through
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's fine that texts are not going through. I can finally enjoy some peace and quiet.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Yukong has come online
:'''Yukong:''' Big sigh
:'''Yukong:''' Just when I thought nothing will go wrong... I'm leaving
:{Choice} Something the matter?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Something the matter?
:'''Yukong:''' A cycrane delivered an official document, and an emergency meeting is coming up, I gotta go back to the commission
:{Choice} Those wicked cycrane!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You can run from signals, but never cycranes
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why are cycranes so dastardly efficient!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|&lbrack;cry&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} Excellent cycrane!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You can run from signals, but never cycranes
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why are cycranes so dastardly efficient!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
:'''Yukong:''' After all
:'''Yukong:''' "Heron Express &mdash; We Ship Whatever You Want."
:{Choice} Tee-hee... "Ship"!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Tee-hee... "Ship"!

===(Trailblazer), have you seen...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Yukong:''' (Trailblazer), have you seen a starskiff-themed immersia before?
:'''Yukong:''' Young people like you might like it
:{Choice} Never heard of it...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I haven't heard of it, is it popular?
:{Choice} I'm having trouble choosing...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I heard there are many like it, any recommendations?
:'''Yukong:''' Competitive, managerial, modification... there are many sub-genres, what do you like?
:{Choice} Competitive
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I like competitive ones
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'd love to experience the adrenaline-pumping actions that you used to have when piloting
::'''Yukong:''' In that case, I recommend Flight Ace
::'''Yukong:''' It's based on the topography of Xianzhou and was able to recreate many of her dangerous terrains, and emulate her weather conditions. You can even experience some pretty unique acrobatic maneuvers.
::'''Yukong:''' But it might be a little complicated to control for a newbie, you might feel dizziness
:{Choice} Managerial
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I like managerial ones
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I wanna experience managing and leading the Sky-Faring Commission and its troops like you
::'''Yukong:''' I'd recommend Sky-Faring Helm Master
::'''Yukong:''' You will be responsible for the job allocation of pilots and other employees, as well as starskiffs' R&D, upgrade, and strategies formulation in simulated wars
::'''Yukong:''' But it completely recreates a war in real time, and a war can be as short as several years to as long as decades...
:{Choice} Modification
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I like modification ones
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I wanna mod my own starskiff. The driving experience isn't important to me, as long as its appearance has a unique personality.
::'''Yukong:''' I recommend Extreme Flight: Skyline
::'''Yukong:''' Technically, it's still a competitive-type immersia, it's just its modification system is too robust, so players love to customize their own starskiff inside...
::'''Yukong:''' Its weakness... well, aside from making you obsess over every detail in it, there really isn't any
:{Choice} Gonna try it next time
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Tight, I'm gonna try it next time!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 01.png|80px|&lbrack;Greet&rbrack;]]
