===(Trailblazer), I heard about...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' (Trailblazer), I heard about a new hotpot store. It's packed with people and has a snaking queue
:{Choice} You can still use your phone?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' You can still use your phone? I heard you got injured.
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' It's just a scratch
:{Choice} Are your eyes alright?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Really? Your eyes are fine now?
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 16 Jiaoqiu 04.png|80px]]
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' Don't worry, someone is accompanying me
:{Choice} Doesn't seem I need to be worried then!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Really? Well, I was worried about nothing!
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 16 Jiaoqiu 04.png|80px]]
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' Don't worry, someone is accompanying me
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' It won't impede my attempts at exploring a new hotpot place
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' I heard about a hotpot place that's been blowing up recently and is packed full of customers every day.
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' I heard the store signature is the "Tea Hotpot with Pickled Pepper and Chili Oil". There's only a limited amount sold every day. Do you want to try it with me?
:{Choice} Let's go! Crowds mean good food!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Let's go! Crowds mean good food!
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' Let's go! Word on the street is that last night, some customers lined up till the store closed and still didn't get to eat anything
:{Choice} Tea? Chili oil? Pickled pepper?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Tea? Chili oil? Pickled pepper? Is that even edible?
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' Of course. The premium tea broth is accompanied by chili oil, removing the spiciness and increasing the aroma and taste. You can have a bowl to sip before you eat, as soon as the hotpot is boiling
:{Choice} We won't queue for years, right?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We won't have to queue for years, right?
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' It's not that bad
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' Even on the Xianzhou, that much of a wait is a bit of a stretch
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Hold on, the online queue is opening. Time to fight for a number on the jade abacus
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Jiaoqiu has gone offline.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Jiaoqiu is online.
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Guess what?
:{Choice} Sounds like you didn't get it
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds like you didn't get a number. Do that many people want to eat this?
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' As long as "limited" is in the marketing, it'll go viral one way or another
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' The store is also offering a few new flavors for soup bases
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' But I'm not sure if they're palatable for you
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Coriander Hotpot
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Oof. This first one. I just can't
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' And then, there's Tomato Hotpot with Arugula
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Tallow Hotpot with Cheese
:{Choice} What if I say yes to all
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What if I say I can take them all?
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' Brave warrior, I admire your courage
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' For today's meal, I'll accompany your culinary choices till the end of the world!
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' Then, I'll go ahead to queue up first
:{Choice} I can't stomach this
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sorry, I really can't stomach this
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' That's too bad. Guess I'll have to go alone
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' I'll come back alive

===If any of you...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' If any of you is recently experiencing loss of appetite or diarrhea, feel free to get some "Ginseng Vigor Dust" from the Yaoqing's military medical office
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Prescription: Take after meals, twice a day, one dose each in the morning and evening. Continue for 5 days. If no improvement, contact me anytime
:{Choice} Okay, doc
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Okay doc. Give me a dose of Ginseng Vigor Dust then
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' ...Apologies. Seems like I hit the wrong contacts for the group message
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Would you happen to need the medicine as well?
:{Choice} I entered a spicy challenge
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Yes, because I entered a stupidly spicy challenge
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' I see
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' A few of the Yaoqing comrades have been suffering recently due to their meals
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Although I've already urged them to re-screen the food caterers, it's going to take some time for it to happen
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Also, foods that have conflicting properties, such as overly oily and spicy or too cold and too hot, may also cause gastrointestinal discomfort
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' But you can't stop the ones who just love to chase the high of the thrill
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' I just took a dose of Ginseng Vigor Dust myself, to be honest
:{Choice} You too, huh...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' You too, huh... Then you're definitely feeling like me now
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Can't help it
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' No one can withstand the allure of a super spicy dish

===(Trailblazer), do you know...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' (Trailblazer), do you know where the Ditings on the Xianzhou Luofu usually hang out?
:{Choice} I know! Starskiff Haven docks!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I know! Starskiff Haven docks!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' March said that, if you can't find them, you can howl twice to summon them
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Howl twice... That doesn't seem like a good idea
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' I saw a Diting once at Starwatcher Avenue. It was chewing aggressively on a wooden table leg along the streets
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' It looked really cute, but unfortunately, table legs can't really withstand a Diting's teeth
:{Choice} Using table legs as chew sticks?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It must be using the table leg as a chew stick
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' Truly an Artisanship Commission ingenium
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' But that table leg is tasteless despite its colors. The little Diting won't be satisfied chewing on it
:{Choice} Does the Diting need to compensate
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It broke the table leg? Did the boss get the Diting to pay for the damage?
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' Yeah, the boss was fuming and said he now has a bone to pick with the Artisanship Commission
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' Luckily, I was passing by and helped it pay off the debt for the table leg
::'''Jiaoqiu:''' You could even say that the Artisanship Commission now owes me a favor
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Since I have nothing to do on the Luofu at the time, I went ahead and made differently flavored chew sticks for it as a way to kill time
:{Choice} What's the stick's flavor?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm curious. What's the stick's flavor?
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' To figure out this little fella's preference, I bought a classic flavored chew stick
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' During the refinement process, I added a little cinnamon, mint, and grated cheese
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' And of course, chili
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' I'm kidding. I just happened to be preparing some fried chilis that look like chili but don't taste spicy at all
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' There are a few leftover ingredients, just enough to make some chew sticks
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' Pity. The little one won't be getting a taste of that for a while
:'''Jiaoqiu:''' May we meet again
