:{Choice} Why didn't you tell me about your new book?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' She keeps encouraging me to try the Simulated Universe out, yet she never tells me about her new book. Does she even see me as her friend? I'm so disappointed.
:{Choice} Saw your ad. Looks nice!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' She's gorgeous.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh, I mean, you look gorgeous in it.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I passed by the space station just now and saw your advertisement. It's great.

:'''Herta:''' For matters related to business-based collaborations, ask Asta.
:{Choice} That's not why I'm here!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's not what I want to talk about!!!
:{Choice} Just wanna talk. Don't need to bother her.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I just happened to stumble upon the ad, and I'm not here to talk about collaborating.

::{Choice} You're so good at brushing me off.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' ...This is clearly an Automatic Reply.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' The least you can do is type your messages to me.
:{Choice} (Make up a long story to get her signature)
::'''(Trailblazer):''' After spending some time in the Simulated Universe, I've gained some insights about the laws of the universe that I'd like to share with you.
::'''Herta:''' ?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' When I went deeper into the Simulated Universe, I saw a black hole. What exactly am I discussing when I talk about a black hole? I guess it's a kind of mysticism, given it is one of the most mysterious phenomena in the universe. It has such a strong gravitational field that even the light is sucked into it. It's a masterpiece of general relativity, a being so colossal that it distorts space and time in an almost unimaginable way.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Will I see the core of Nihility after passing through the black hole? It gives me a sense of detachment as if it is the graveyard of space and time. We might be reluctant to admit it, but it undoubtedly exists. When we stand face to face with each other, there is a massive black hole between us.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm a Nameless from the Astral Express, and the way the Nihility is affecting me is unbearable. Now... I need a small favor from you.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' May I have the collector edition of your new book with your autograph on the title page?
::'''Herta:''' From where did you copy this?
::'''Herta:''' I'm not going to read it. It's too long.
