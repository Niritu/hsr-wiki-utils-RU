:{Choice} You secretly joined the Wardance?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' You secretly joined the Wardance? Why didn't you tell me?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Message Firefly Lordly Trashcan.png|256px]]
:'''Firefly:''' ???
:'''Firefly:''' This isn't me
:'''Firefly:''' I'd never wear something so... rotund.
:'''Firefly:''' Hang on. Silver Wolf has been on the Luofu these few days. Could she be pulling a prank?
:'''Firefly:''' I'll call her and ask. Hold on
:'''Firefly:''' She physically rolled on the floor laughing after hearing this
:'''Firefly:''' She's still laughing. Hold on
:'''Firefly:''' She's still laughing so hard... she's about to choke
:'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Speechless&rbrack;]]
:'''Firefly:''' She stopped and said it wasn't her
:'''Firefly:''' It appears someone is using my identity to participate in the Wardance
:{Choice} So someone is impersonating you!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I thought it was your new gear or something. So it's someone impersonating you!
::'''Firefly:''' Why would I ever wear such... "new gear"!
:{Choice} I knew it! It was a fake!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's what I thought! I knew it was some weirdo pretending to be you!
::'''Firefly:''' And doing a poor job of it!
:'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 10.png|80px|&lbrack;Angry&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} Luka will teach them a lesson
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't worry. Luka will help you teach them a lesson
:'''Firefly:''' But the culprit didn't do anything overboard. Don't hurt them too bad

:{Choice} What is it?

:{Choice} Show me! Quick!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What is it? Show me plz
:'''Firefly:''' Weird... Is the image too big? Or just the signal acting up?

:{Choice} So many pics!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So many pics! Are the expressions different in all of them?
::'''Firefly:''' They're actually all the same
::'''Firefly:''' It wouldn't send, so I ended up spamming the "Send" button...
:{Choice} I'mma save them all!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Awesome! I'm saving them all!
::'''Firefly:''' No, no. You don't need to. They're all the same
::'''Firefly:''' It wouldn't send, so I ended up spamming the "Send" button...
:'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px]]
:'''Firefly:''' BTW, (Trailblazer), you seem like a pro at taking selfies
:'''Firefly:''' Any framing tips or expression recommendations for selfies? Please teach me your ways!
:{Choice} [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 03.png|80px]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 03.png|80px]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Try this
::'''Firefly:''' That's adorable!
::'''Firefly:''' But can I really pull off this expression? Should I practice it first?
::'''Firefly:''' Plus, I've never seen this expression on you either, (Trailblazer)
:{Choice} [[File:Sticker PPG 12 Other 01.png|80px]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 12 Other 01.png|80px]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Try this
::'''Firefly:''' It doesn't look like there's much of an expression here...
::'''Firefly:''' But the pose isn't hard to mimic. I'll try practicing it
:{Choice} [[File:Sticker PPG 13 Other 01.png|80px]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 13 Other 01.png|80px]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Try this
::'''Firefly:''' I think I've seen props like this in Penacony before...
::'''Firefly:''' Oh, sunglasses!
::'''Firefly:''' Looks cool, I'll try that out!
:'''Firefly:''' Let's take a group photo together next time!

===(Trailblazer), you there?===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Firefly:''' (Trailblazer), you there?
:'''Firefly:''' I'm at Oti Mall now
:'''Firefly:''' Kafka wants me to grab some Penacony souvenirs for her, but she didn't say what
:'''Firefly:''' Would you happen to have any ideas?
:{Choice} Leave it to me
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Leave it to me
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Kafka and I did exchange a few blows before, after all
::'''Firefly:''' That's fantastic news!
::'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px]]
:{Choice} Why not ask Silver Wolf, though?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why not ask Silver Wolf, though? She can probably give you a ton of ideas
::'''Firefly:''' I did
::'''Firefly:''' She said that Kafka would love anything I pick
::'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 15.png|80px]]
:{Choice} Sorry, I don't really know her that well...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sorry, I don't really know her that well...
::'''Firefly:''' Is that so?
::'''Firefly:''' Kafka talks about you all the time, so I thought you knew each other well
::'''Firefly:''' Sorry, I didn't mean to put you on the spot
::'''Firefly:''' But I'd still love to hear any suggestions you may have, (Trailblazer)
::'''Firefly:''' Please!
::'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 01.png|80px]]
:'''Firefly:''' All I can think of are coats, lipsticks, sunglasses, and so on... But she seems to have plenty of those already
:{Choice} Just pick from those three
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Just pick any of those three types
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Gifts are nice, but it's still the thought that counts in the end
:{Choice} Lipstick
::'''(Trailblazer):''' A lipstick is a great choice
::'''Firefly:''' Kafka once gave me a lipstick
::'''Firefly:''' A light pink with a peach scent, just like jelly. She said it suited me perfectly
::'''Firefly:''' Come to think of it, a lipstick would make a great gift in return
:{Choice} Coat
::'''(Trailblazer):''' A coat is a great choice
::'''Firefly:''' A coat, huh... If it's a handcrafted piece from Penacony, I bet Kafka would love it
:{Choice} Sunglasses
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sunglasses are a great choice
::'''Firefly:''' Kafka once mentioned that sunglasses don't take up much space, so she'd buy lots of them, no matter the style
:{Choice} How's your wallet holding up?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Things in Penacony are pretty pricey, though. How's your wallet holding up?
:'''Firefly:''' Kafka gave me her credit card and said I can use it as much as I want, but it feels weird spending somebody else's money, so I never did...
:{Choice} Are the Stellaron Hunters still hiring?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Are the Stellaron Hunters still hiring?
::'''Firefly:''' You'll break Pom-Pom's heart if you say that
::'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px]]
:{Choice} My Express job also comes with some perks
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The Astral Express does also give me plenty of perks...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Alright, enough chitchat. I'm going to look for Pom-Pom
::'''Firefly:''' Sounds great!
::'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px]]

:'''Firefly:''' Check this out! I'm on a planet famous for its island resorts!
:'''Firefly:''' It's only 05:00 system hour here, still early in the morning, but there are already a bunch of people out surfing!
:'''Firefly:''' You know, when the ocean mirrors the sky, it's hard to tell if they're right in front of me or far off in the distance. It's almost like they're soaring on the horizon
:'''Firefly:''' Have you ever had that feeling?
:{Choice} Yes, when I couldn't sleep
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yes, when I couldn't sleep
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Still... It's 5 AM. Why are you up so early?
:{Choice} I'm an early bird
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm up early every day. Bet you didn't expect that!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But you're up really early too
:{Choice} I don't need sleep
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I don't need sleep. Bet you didn't expect that!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Nah, just kidding
::'''Firefly:''' Ah, that's me, actually
:'''Firefly:''' I was born without the ability to dream, and I sleep much less than most. A quick rest is enough to fill me with energy
:'''Firefly:''' That's why I love climbing to high places at the break of dawn
:'''Firefly:''' Whether it's by the ocean, in the forest, or up in the mountains, I just love watching the sunrise and feeling the start of a new day in every world
:'''Firefly:''' It's an incredible feeling. Give it a go when you can!
:{Choice} I'd love to
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds amazing. Take me with you next time!
::'''Firefly:''' Really? Awesome!
::'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 12.png|80px]]
::'''Firefly:''' I was worried that you might say no!
:{Choice} I'm not a morning person
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm not really a morning person...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The trailblazing expedition can get really intense. But if you can wake me up early...
::'''Firefly:''' I can try. I'll let the conductor know that I'll be dropping by the Express at that time
::'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px]]
:{Choice} I have training at 4 AM
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm super busy in the morning. I have training at 4 AM
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Ever seen the Astral Express at 4 AM?
::'''Firefly:''' Wow! That's some impressive willpower
::'''Firefly:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px]]
:'''Firefly:''' But there are so many bugs outdoors sometimes, and they always seem to find me...
:{Choice} They're just bugs
::'''(Trailblazer):''' They're just bugs. Nothing to be scared of
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 14 Other 01.png|80px]]
::'''Firefly:''' Yeah, you're right
::'''Firefly:''' Plus, I can just stay back
:{Choice} Bugs totally freak me out!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Bugs totally freak me out! Just seeing them makes me cringe
::'''Firefly:''' Haha, I've got a great trick to keep the bugs away. Leave it to me!
:{Choice} Don't tell me that trick is...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is your trick what I think it is?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I will...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' set the seas
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ablaze!
::'''Firefly:''' You guessed right
::'''Firefly:''' Cool!
