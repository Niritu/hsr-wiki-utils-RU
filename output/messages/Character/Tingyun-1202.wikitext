===Benefactor, I'd like to...===

:'''Tingyun:''' Benefactor, I'd like to ask you something
:{Choice} What is it?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' What is it?
:'''Tingyun:''' This may be disrespectful, but I'm very curious...
:'''Tingyun:''' Is the Express really here just to help the Xianzhou Luofu solve the Stellaron problem?
:{Choice} Yes. Why?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is it really that hard to understand why the Express is here? Can't someone act simply out of the kindness of their heart?
:{Choice} What are you trying to say?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is it really that hard to understand why the Express is here? Can't someone act simply out of the kindness of their heart?
:'''Tingyun:''' After all, people who help others without thinking of compensation or risks during the dangerous trips across the cosmos is rarer than air in vacuum
:'''Tingyun:''' When the higher-ups of Xianzhou first heard of your reasons for coming, they thought you were here either to seek immortality or the Stellaron...
:{Choice} Seek immortality?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Seeking immortality is absolutely forbidden on the Xianzhou, no?
::'''Tingyun:''' Yes. As the home of long-life species, countless Elixir Seekers from all corners of the universe come to the Xianzhou to re-enact bygone histories and discover the secret of the Xianzhou residents' immortality
:{Choice} Seek the Stellaron?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Stellarons are the seeds of ruin. Why would the Express want the Stellaron?
::'''Tingyun:''' But not everyone in the cosmos thinks this way. As a seed dispersed by an Aeon, some desire to obtain its power regardless of the cost
:'''Tingyun:''' Apologies, I may have crossed the line. I don't know why I said all this
:'''Tingyun:''' I have absolute trust in your sincerity, benefactor, but the powerful masters are bound to think more than a pawn like me
:'''Tingyun:''' So, please be careful...

===Say, did you see that, benefactor?===

|start_condition =

:'''Tingyun:''' Say, did you see that, benefactor?
:'''Tingyun:''' When the Ebon Deer's stomped the ground, branches sprouted out of nowhere
:{Choice} I saw
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Those must be... the Ambrosial Arbor's roots?
:{Choice} Branches?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Those must be... the Ambrosial Arbor's roots?
:'''Tingyun:''' The celestial traces of Abundance are indeed marvelous to behold
:'''Tingyun:''' This is the first time I've seen something so miraculous among all my travels
:'''Tingyun:''' The fruits on those boughs are sparkling gold, just like what the Xianzhou legends say
:'''Tingyun:''' It is said that in ancient times, the forebears of the Xianzhou received immortal fruits like this of the Ambrosial Arbor and turned into long-life species
:'''Tingyun:''' If I were to eat this fruit, would I obtain endless life just like the Xianzhou natives...?
:'''Tingyun:''' Are you not tempted by such a chance, benefactor?
:{Choice} A dangerous thought...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Miss Tingyun, wouldn't you be breaching the Xianzhou ban?
::'''Tingyun:''' Ahh
::'''Tingyun:''' Please pardon me for my rudeness and my little test
::'''Tingyun:''' As I thought, you are an honest and righteous person, benefactor
:{Choice} Can't leave if you eat it...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' If you eat this fruit, I'm afraid you won't get to live for a thousand years... but executed by the Cloud Knights moments after.
::'''Tingyun:''' You're right, benefactor
::'''Tingyun:''' But if you manage to get past the Cloud Knights' searches
::'''Tingyun:''' This opportunity seems too good to pass up, right?
:{Choice} Oh, I was tempted...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Then... Miss Tingyun... did you save a fruit?
::'''Tingyun:''' If I say yes, would you want to share it with me, benefactor?
:'''Tingyun:''' But I thank you for the thought, benefactor
:'''Tingyun:''' Unfortunately, the Ebon Deer is now dust, and no fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor is left behind
:'''Tingyun:''' Such opportunities are extremely rare, but they slip away in the blink of an eye.
:'''Tingyun:''' Just like life itself...

===What a dilemma, dear benefactor===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Tingyun:''' What a dilemma, dear benefactor
:'''Tingyun:''' My tail is frizzy again
:'''Tingyun:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 19 Fugue 03.png|80px]]
:{Choice} More power means more trouble
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It seems that the most powerful people are often the most troubled
:{Choice} Need a hand?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Need a hand?
::'''Tingyun:''' I don't want you to see how I look now, my benefactor
:'''Tingyun:''' In the past, no matter where I travel, I'd always bring with me a boxwood comb. I'd comb my tail, condition it with fragrant balm, and carefully wrap it with a special gauze. The procedure may sound simple, but it takes me an entire dual-hour
:'''Tingyun:''' If I were to comb every strand of my fur with this kind of care now, I doubt I would have time for sleep and other commitments
:'''Tingyun:''' Benefactor, do you have any self-care tips?
:{Choice} Join the Express Crew
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Join the Express Crew, and you'll always shine in the eyes of others
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 03.png|80px]]
::'''Tingyun:''' I'm envious &mdash; boarding the Chromatic Echelon has always been my dream
:{Choice} Go to a Space Anchor to refresh
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Head to a Space Anchor and freshen up to reinvigorate yourself again &mdash; also known as a "refresh."
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't you find the Space Anchors amazing?
::'''Tingyun:''' Oh? Seems like the Nameless do have their own way of doing things...
:{Choice} I'm born looking good
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sorry. The Baseballer doesn't need to go the extra mile for looks &mdash; I was born this good-looking
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 03.png|80px]]
::'''Tingyun:''' Oh? I'm envious of you
:'''Tingyun:''' Gosh, it might be a hassle, but there's no way I'm letting my tail look pathetic
:'''Tingyun:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 19 Fugue 01.png|80px]]
:'''Tingyun:''' I shall also seek advice from Madam Ruan Mei and Madam Yukong
:'''Tingyun:''' Talk to you later, benefactor~

{{Messages|text=
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Attachment ''Neck Stretches for Beginners &vert; 10-minute Relaxation Stretching'' has been sent
:'''Tingyun:''' Benefactor, Madam Ruan Mei taught me some rehabilitation exercises to help with my recovery. I've extracted a portion of the recording for you
:'''Tingyun:''' The Chromatic Echelon has been journeying across the Cosmos, and these long trips must have taken a toll on your bodies. Perhaps the exercises in this video can help relieve some of that strain
:{Choice} A genius is omnipotent
::'''(Trailblazer):''' As expected, a genius is omnipotent in all respects
:{Choice} It must be effective
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You seem to be recovering well. These exercises must be effective
:'''Tingyun:''' Madam Ruan Mei has thoughtfully incorporated traditional Xianzhou dance steps into these exercises.
:'''Tingyun:''' The learning curve may be steep, but if you persevere, your body will feel as light as a feather
:'''Tingyun:''' While I sensed that this might be a casual innovation from Madam Ruan Mei, and she didn't seem to care about it
:'''Tingyun:''' I still hope to give this dance a beautiful name and share it with those in the Cosmos who need it
:'''Tingyun:''' Benefactor, do you have any suggestions regarding a name?
:{Choice} Ab Ripper!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Ab Ripper: The Excruciating Challenge!
::'''Tingyun:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 19 Tingyun 01.png|80px]]
::'''Tingyun:''' That's even more click-baiting than I anticipated
::'''Tingyun:''' Anyone who sees the name will be tempted to click on the video
:{Choice} Xianzhou Rhythmic Aerobics!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Xianzhou Rhythmic Aerobics Set 10!
::'''Tingyun:''' Sounds healthy and catchy
::'''Tingyun:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 19 Tingyun 01.png|80px]]
:{Choice} Ruan Mei Stretch!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Ruan Mei's "10-Minute Cardio Dance" Stretch!

===Benefactor, sorry for bothering you===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Tingyun:''' Benefactor, sorry for bothering you
:'''Tingyun:''' I had previously visited planet Thalassa and obtained a pile of freshly harvested Thalassan lightfish
:'''Tingyun:''' This rare ingredient is harvested from deep reefs and boasts a sweet flavor. It is valuable as food and medicine. I'm delivering it to you for a taste
:'''Tingyun:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 19 Fugue 01.png|80px]]
:{Choice} You're so generous!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're so generous!
::'''Tingyun:''' I do not intend to keep a mere transactional relationship between you and me
:{Choice} I'll make a feast out of it!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll certainly take it and make a feast out of it!
::'''Tingyun:''' It's enough to feed the entire Express, so take your time
:'''Tingyun:''' When I returned to Thalassa, the people over there were still treating me like before
:'''Tingyun:''' I suppose they haven't heard of news concerning me, which might actually be a blessing in disguise
:'''Tingyun:''' I wonder how my old pals would react when I return to the Luofu...
:{Choice} "Good job, girl"
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yanming will probably tell you, "Good job, girl!"
::'''Tingyun:''' I'm curious about how the Celestial Guild is doing. There are so many business matters I'd like to consult him about
:{Choice} "Tingyun, let's have tea"
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Mengming will definitely invite you over for tea
::'''(Trailblazer):''' She created a new tea blend based on your suggestion and named it "Tingyun's Blend"
::'''Tingyun:''' I can imagine the sweet and lingering aftertaste of the tea based on that name
:{Choice} "Tingyun, time for beef offal stew!"
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yancui has received the knife you got for her and promised to prepare a plate of Chili Oil Beef Offal Stew for you
::'''Tingyun:''' It's been a long time since I heard that dish name. I'm salivating
::'''Tingyun:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 19 Tingyun 01.png|80px]]
:'''Tingyun:''' Madam Yukong has also mentioned you were the one who had delivered these gifts I'd prepared for them
:'''Tingyun:''' Thank you, benefactor
:'''Tingyun:''' Now, I can finally set off on my journey again at ease
:'''Tingyun:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 19 Fugue 01.png|80px]]
