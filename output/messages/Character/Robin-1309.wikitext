:'''Robin:''' (Trailblazer), are you still on Penacony?
:'''Robin:''' I have a favor to ask...
:{Choice} Do tell.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I am
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What is it?
:{Choice} Not there right now.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm not there right now
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait for me to return if it's not urgent
:'''Robin:''' Ah, actually... it's about the Grand Theater
:'''Robin:''' You may have heard about the Oak Family's past proclamation that guests will be absolutely safe &mdash; that is all thanks to Order's power
:'''Robin:''' But this strength has since almost dissipated on Penacony, which also means that in the present dreams, "death" is not an impossibility
:'''Robin:''' When my older brother and I crashed onto the land back then, I was thrust into unconscious darkness... But when I awoke, I was surrounded by nurses, and my brother was nowhere to be seen
:'''Robin:''' I wanted to know if he was safe, but they refused to tell me... It is out of desperation that I would ask you if you could look for my brother in the Grand Theater
:'''Robin:''' Even a tiny clue would be assuring
:'''Robin:''' I'm now, really
:'''Robin:''' really afraid
:{Choice} Don't worry. Leave it to me.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Understood
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Leave it to me. I'll think of something
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm sure he's fine
:{Choice} Prepare for the worst...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Got it. I'll help
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But I can't guarantee results
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You'll have to prepare for the worst...
:'''Robin:''' ...
:'''Robin:''' Thank you, (Trailblazer).
:'''Robin:''' I'm eternally thankful
:'''Robin:''' If you find anything, look for me near the ticketing booth
:'''Robin:''' I'll be disguised as an Intellitron dressed in blue formal attire, to avoid the Hounds' noses
:'''Robin:''' Please...

:'''Robin:''' (Trailblazer), how's it going?
:{Choice} Pretty good. How about you?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Pretty good. How about you? Been busy?
::'''Robin:''' The preparation for my performance is almost done, so I'm free today
:{Choice} A superstar is texting me!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wow! A message from a superstar! I'm truly honored!
::'''Robin:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px]]
::'''Robin:''' I'll take that as a joke. There's no need for us to be so formal with each other, right?
:'''Robin:''' Just listened to a blues instrumental called 'Flowerwild.' It's perfect for playing on the Express to help relax. Sharing it with you, hope you like it.
:{Choice} What's the song like?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What's the song like?
::'''Robin:''' Hmm... It's a song that carries some floral scents
::'''Robin:''' If you listen closely to this piece, it's as if you're amidst a sea of flowers... with windmills turning in the distance and sunlight casting over a maiden's skirt. Truly wondrous
:{Choice} It rings a bell
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It rings a bell
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The Phonograph on the Express has played the song before. The conductor said they caught the scent of flowers after listening to it!
::'''Robin:''' That's right! I feel the same way
::'''Robin:''' Listen closely to this piece, and it's as if you're amidst a sea of flowers... with windmills turning in the distance and sunlight casting over a maiden's skirt. Truly wondrous
::'''Robin:''' By the way, there's something important I need to tell you... It might come as a surprise to you

::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px]]
::'''Robin:''' The location of my upcoming concert isn't far from Penacony, so I took the liberty of having the butler send some VIP concert tickets to the Express Crew...
::'''Robin:''' Because of my tight rehearsal schedule, I didn't give you a heads-up beforehand. Please forgive me
::{Choice} I don't mind at all
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Thanks, Miss Robin! I wouldn't mind at all!
::{Choice} I'll make time for it!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Thanks, Miss Robin! I'll make time for it!

::'''(Trailblazer):''' Your songs are great too. There's something inspiring about them

::'''Robin:''' Hearing you say that puts me at ease. I'll keep pushing forward
:{Choice} Please keep the recommendations coming
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Love the music! Please keep the recommendations coming
::'''Robin:''' Of course!
::'''Robin:''' Next time I come across some good music, I'll make sure to share it with you

===(Trailblazer), do you think......===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Robin:''' (Trailblazer), do you think... a bird with broken wings still has a chance to fly?
:{Choice} There's hope as long as it's alive
::'''(Trailblazer):''' There's hope as long as it's alive
::'''Robin:''' Yes, your thought echoes mine
::'''Robin:''' I saw a little bird with one of its wings broken on the panorama floor a few days ago. My heart went out to it
:{Choice} Hard to say
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's hard to say. I need to look at it in more detail
::'''Robin:''' Is that so... You are not wrong to think that way. After all, fate isn't predetermined, and a brief occurrence doesn't shape the future
::{Choice} Did something happen?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Did something happen?
::'''Robin:''' I saw a little bird with a broken wing on the panorama floor a few days ago. My heart went out to it
:'''Robin:''' I brought it back home, hoping it would make a fast recovery
:'''Robin:''' Has my brother told you the story of a little Charmony Dove?
:'''Robin:''' That poor Charmony Dove formed a big part of our childhood and taught us about "making choices" for the first time
:{Choice} I remember the story
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I remember the story. It's a tragic one
:{Choice} No recollection of it whatsoever
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I have no recollection of it whatsoever
::'''Robin:''' Don't worry about it
:'''Robin:''' Looking back now, I realize we only gave it the right to live when we were little, but we had no clue how to ensure its survival thereafter
:'''Robin:''' But then again, who can truly define the rules of life?
:'''Robin:''' Compared to the Charmony Dove which had to learn how to fly from scratch, this little bird is luckier
:'''Robin:''' Hm? Hold on
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Robin has gone offline
:{Choice} What's wrong
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What's wrong
:{Choice} Something happened to the bird?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Did something happen to the little bird?
:{Choice} I'm still waiting
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Please get back to me! I'm begging you
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Your friend Robin has come online
:'''Robin:''' So sorry about that! I was so excited when I saw the little bird flap its wings just now, so I immediately rushed over and observed it for a while
:'''Robin:''' Seeing the little bird get better gradually fills me with joy
:'''Robin:''' It feels like I've resolved a regret from my childhood
:{Choice} I'll remember this
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll remember this day! Truly a memorable one
::'''Robin:''' Thank you! Without your encouraging words, I'm afraid I would have stopped believing in the little bird's recovery already
:{Choice} The bird seems happy too
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The bird seems happy too. Perhaps, it has its own wishes too
::'''Robin:''' Indeed, I hope the little bird can fly high again. Thanks for your words of encouragement, (Trailblazer)
:'''Robin:''' I've got to go take care of this little bird now
:'''Robin:''' Just wait for my good news~

===I discovered a fascinating...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Robin:''' I discovered a fascinating accessory shop! Ice cream necklaces, raccoon brooches, sunflower glasses, and monster hairclips~
:'''Robin:''' There are tons of adorable items, some of which are perfect for the Express Crew. If possible... I'd love to pick some for you all
:{Choice} Let's be cute together!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yay! Let's be cute together!
::'''Robin:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 03.png|80px]]
:{Choice} I appreciate your generosity!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I appreciate your generosity!
::'''Robin:''' No worries. These accessories are all unique and make perfect gifts
:{Choice} Save the cutest one for Mr. Yang!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Save the cutest one for Mr. Yang!
::'''Robin:''' So Mr. Yang's into cutey stuff deep down, huh?
::'''Robin:''' I have a rough idea of what to pick now!
:'''Robin:''' A baseball bat cheering stick, a clover leaf hairpin with lights, a book-shaped storage box, a mini chef's hat, a vintage paper handbag, and a Clockie mech badge.
:'''Robin:''' (Trailblazer), what do you think of these?
:{Choice} Everyone's going to love them
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Trust me, everyone's going to love them!
::'''Robin:''' Seems like I know a thing or two about the Express Crew now!
::'''Robin:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 03.png|80px]]
:{Choice} The chef's hat is...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The chef's hat is...
::'''Robin:''' It's for the conductor
::'''Robin:''' During your time on Penacony, Miss March once told me your conductor. She said the conductor always kept the Express in good order
::'''Robin:''' Most importantly, the conductor can make incredibly tasty dishes and desserts. That's why it didn't take me long to choose the mini chef's hat for the conductor
:{Choice} They sell baseball bats?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm surprised the store sells baseball bats
::'''Robin:''' Actually, I got the store owner to customize it for me
::'''Robin:''' When chatting and flipping through photos, we talked about baseball bats. He thought turning one into a cheer stick was a fun idea, so he agreed to help make one on the spot.
:'''Robin:''' I'm on my way to posting the gifts to you now. Remember to check your mail
