:'''Geed:''' How's the progress?
:'''Geed:''' Have you finished all the IPC's assignments
:{Choice} I've taken care of everything...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah... I got all the special assignments that you mentioned done... Is there anything else?
:'''Geed:''' ?
:'''Geed:''' Wait. Let me refresh
:'''Geed:''' Pretty good, (Trailblazer). How'd you do it? I'm still looking at Boothill's details, but you managed to complete so many assignments on your own
:{Choice} It was a piece of cake.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Easy peasy. Nothing I couldn't handle
::'''Geed:''' ...As expected from someone who fought off the Doomsday Beast with their bare hands
:{Choice} I had plenty of help...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Well... I didn't do this alone either. I had lots of friends that helped
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah. I'm really grateful to them.
::'''Geed:''' I know. You've got some "big-shot" connections. Wen Shiqi told me so
::'''Geed:''' Even Madam Herta favors you. Ah, If I could only be as effective and influential as you someday
:'''Geed:''' Right, did you get your payment? If you ask me, you shouldn't risk your life for money. Just make enough to live comfortably
:'''Geed:''' You weren't injured, were you?
:{Choice} Nope, didn't even mess up my hair.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Of course not. It's no big deal... My hair didn't even get messed up. Wasn't anything
::'''Geed:''' That's impressive
:{Choice} I'm good. Don't you worry.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm plenty tough. Don't you worry
::'''Geed:''' That's good
:'''Geed:''' Alright. Enough chatter. The department is asking me to submit my report and the page is still blank
:'''Geed:''' You go home and get some rest. I'll let you know if something good like this happens again
