:'''Wilder:''' Hello!
:'''Wilder:''' Is this (Trailblazer)?
:'''Wilder:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 01.png|80px|&lbrack;Greet&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} Yes, I am.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah, I am. Who might you be
::'''Wilder:''' That's good
:{Choice} No, I'm not.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sorry, you got the wrong person
::'''Wilder:''' Wrong person? But the number here suggests otherwise
:'''Wilder:''' Anyway, please allow me to introduce myself.
:'''Wilder:''' I'm Wilder from the Interastral Peace Corporation's Strategic Investment Department
:'''Wilder:''' I'm contacting you to recommend you a video game
:{Choice} What game?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Game? Awesome! What game?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} Not interested.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sorry, can we talk later? I'm busy with something else right now.
::'''Wilder:''' Hey, please don't block me so fast! Maybe you'll be interested after hearing more information about this game!
:{Choice} Another promotion...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Doesn't your company have other ways for promotion...?
::'''Wilder:''' Haha, even with so much advanced technology, text messages are still the best way to develop rapport with people
:'''Wilder:''' Now, please allow me to get back to the introduction
:'''Wilder:''' This game is called Aetherium Wars. It's a galactic-tier, top-class AAA cultural brand spearheaded by the IPC's Marketing Development Department in collaboration with the Interastral Network and Interastral Peace Media.
:{Choice} It's that good?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That impressive?
::'''Wilder:''' Hahaha, it's one of our blockbusters after all.
:{Choice} Get to the point...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Just get to the point...
::'''Wilder:''' Don't worry. I'm getting there.
:'''Wilder:''' Aetherium Wars is a card-collection game, but it's nothing like the ordinary trading card games you've imagined!
:'''Wilder:''' Here, you can use the IPC's cutting-edge Aether copying technology to record any creature you've ever seen inside an Aether Coin.
:'''Wilder:''' And then you can print them out and use them to compete against other players! Let your Aether Spirits fight for your glory!
:'''Wilder:''' How does it sound? Pretty cool, right?
:{Choice} Sounds interesting.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|&lbrack;Thumbs Up&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds fun. Where can I play this game?
::'''Wilder:''' Haha, awesome! I finally got a new player for my favorite game!
:{Choice} It's kinda mid.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|&lbrack;Confused&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This doesn't sound as fun as Cosmic Warfare...
::'''Wilder:''' Cosmic Warfare? Seriously!? It's nowhere near as interesting as the Aetherium Wars!
:{Choice} Calm down.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px|&lbrack;Shocked&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why are you so excited all of a sudden?
::'''Wilder:''' Well, to be honest, I'm actually a huge fan of Aetherium Wars myself.
:'''Wilder:''' Anyway, if you're interested, feel free to come to the Rivet Town Plaza in Jarilo-VI to try it for yourself!
:'''Wilder:''' We'll be holding the Interastral Tournament Festival, a great offline carnival for all Aetherium Wars fans! Please do come and enjoy it!
:{Choice} Be right there.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What a coincidence! I'm in Jarilo-VI right now.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't run off. I'll be there soon.
:{Choice} Maybe later.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Uhhhh
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll go over when I have time
:'''Wilder:''' No problem! I'll be here waiting for you!
;{Accepted Mission: Let's Go! Aetherium Wars!}

:{Choice} What's up?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What do you have for me this time?
:{Choice} A new update patch?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Is this a notification about a new update patch?
:'''Wilder:''' No, no, here's the thing.
:'''Wilder:''' Have you heard of Topaz's Support Squad? And an Aether Spirit with personality? A Warp Trotter?
:{Choice} I've met them already.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Topaz's Support Squad? I've actually met some of their members.
:{Choice} I already have the Trotter.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah, I just got my hands on that Warp Trotter.
:'''Wilder:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px|&lbrack;Shocked&rbrack;]]
:'''Wilder:''' That makes it much easier for me!
:'''Wilder:''' Could you please come to the Goethe Hotel in Jarilo-VI?
:'''Wilder:''' I need to discuss something important with you.
