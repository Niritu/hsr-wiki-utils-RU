:{{DIcon|Warning}} The Message Doll has initiated a temporary conversation.
:'''Message Doll:''' Cool
:'''Message Doll:''' That feels so cool, don't you think?
:{Choice} Wait, more bombs?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Huh? More bombs to defuse?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Just give me the coordinates, and I'll defuse the bomb
::'''Message Doll:''' Well, there are only 1,000 bombs. Miss Sparkle never breaks her words~
::'''Message Doll:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 12 Sparkle 01.png|80px|&lbrack;image&rbrack; Crying mask sticker]]
::'''Message Doll:''' I'm just here to spill the beans on Miss Sparkle's motive, got it?
:{Choice} Please, just leave me alone.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Come on!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't text me anymore. I don't want Pom-Pom to get the wrong idea
::'''Message Doll:''' Think you can mess with me? Well, you just stepped on chewing gum. I'll stick to you forever!
::'''Message Doll:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 12 Sparkle 02.png|80px|&lbrack;image&rbrack; Naughty smile sticker]]
::'''Message Doll:''' By the way, Miss Sparkle hasn't even revealed her motive yet! Aren't you curious?
::'''Message Doll:''' Do you remember the prophesied "three deaths"?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What's that got to do with you?
::'''Message Doll:''' Who knows? All I can say is that someone paid a hefty sum to hire Miss Sparkle as the director at Penacony.
::'''Message Doll:''' Seems like it's a friend she made while gaming. The client told Miss Sparkle to make sure the "three deaths" happen in the safest way possible
::'''Message Doll:''' In return, they shared their "script" with Miss Sparkle
::'''Message Doll:''' And what happened next... Well, a smart cookie like you can surely guess, Gray Hair!
::'''Message Doll:''' However, Miss Sparkle isn't some control freak. She let the actors decide how the story would unfold for themselves
::'''Message Doll:''' Surprise question! Did you press the "Mutually Assured Destruction Button" that Miss Sparkle gave you?
::{Choice} Yeah, I did.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah, I literally mashed it
:::'''Message Doll:''' Well, congratulations! You're the one who reshaped the third death!
::{Choice} No, I didn't.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' No, that button seems way too suspicious
:::'''Message Doll:''' Hmhm, you're a cautious one, huh?
:::'''Message Doll:''' But no worries. Since more than half of the actors pressed the button, the third death went exactly as planned!
::{Choice} I couldn't do it at all.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' I didn't even get the button!
:::'''Message Doll:''' Oh, really? Well, good luck scoring a ticket next time then!
:::'''Message Doll:''' But no worries. Since more than half of the actors pressed the button, the third death went exactly as planned!
::'''Message Doll:''' She soared up in the sky and set off the most epic fireworks Penacony had ever seen, giving a grand finale to this beautiful dream
::'''Message Doll:''' And she herself was safe and sound! Happiest ending ever!
::'''Message Doll:''' So, congrats, Gray Hair. After all, you're the one who made the call and actually saved that firefly girl
::'''Message Doll:''' And that means Miss Sparkle will get paid as promised!
::'''Message Doll:''' Oh
::'''Message Doll:''' By the way, to celebrate the successful grand finale, Miss Sparkle has decided to share another secret with you, Gray Hair
::{Choice} What is it?
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' What is it?
::{Choice} More juicy gossip? Tell me more.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Alright, I'm all ears!
::'''Message Doll:''' You know what?
::'''Message Doll:''' Actually...
::'''Message Doll:''' Dr. Primitive is a huge fan of bananas
::{Choice} Huh?
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Huh?
::{Choice} What do you mean?
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' What do you mean?
::{Choice} Go on.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Go on.

:{Choice} Cool.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Fireworks! Cool!
::'''Message Doll:''' Yeah! You're getting the hang of it, aren't you?
::'''Message Doll:''' So, are you curious about why Miss Sparkle is doing all this?
