===Creation Nurturing Administrative Backend...===

:'''Herta Panopticon System:''' Creation Nurturing Administrative Backend &mdash; Reminder: It is 00:01 "Herta" system time. Yesterday's meals have been administered. Currently generating a Daily Report of Creations' Activities and Risks in the Feeding Area for you.
:'''Herta Panopticon System:''' Daily Report of Creations' Activities and Risks in the Feeding Area: 1. Some creations tried to steal from the bowls of other creations, only to have the latter swallow the rest of the food in one second, shocking all creations present to their core. 2. A creation knocked over their bowl and the food spilled everywhere. It then seemed to realize its mistake and ate all the scattered food, licking the floor until one could see their face in it. This caused a passing-by creation to accidentally trip over. 3. A new creation tried leftover feed from the previous day for the first time. After a brief confusion, it successfully ingested the food. 4. A creation thumped the floor with their tail as they picked their food, all due to the food not being up to their tastes. Later, due to the hardness of the space station's floor, their tailbone fractured. The appendage has been bandaged and is not in a serious condition. 5. A creation invented a new pose and stretched its body as it fed on food, attracting the curious gazes of other creations.

:'''Herta Panopticon System:''' Creation Nurturing Administrative Backend &mdash; Reminder: It is 00:01 "Herta" system time. Yesterday's management of the rest area has ended. Currently generating a Daily Report of Settled Creations' Activities for you.
:'''Herta Panopticon System:''' Daily Report of Settled Creations' Activities and Risks: 1. One creation attempted a big, leisurely stretch while bathing in the starlight, then got injured due to excessive stretching. 2. One creation jumped onto the floor and conversed with its own reflection on the polished floor for 5 minutes. The other creations are very concerned about its mental health. 3. Two creations fell asleep while snuggling against each other. However, one of them experienced a leg cramp and kicked the other dozens of times. Both woke up from the dream and engaged in a heated argument. 4. A passing robot was updating its system today and made strange noises, waking up three creations in the process. 5. Three creations are curled up in the same nest and seeking warmth from each other. The air condition temperature for this area has been reduced.
