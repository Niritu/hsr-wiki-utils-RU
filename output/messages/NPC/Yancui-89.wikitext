:'''(Trailblazer):''' Hello, Yancui
:{Choice} (Tell her about the meal box you found)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I found the lost takeout and sent the coordinates to you. If you have time, it might be good to get a Realm-Keeping Commission clerk to come over and have a look
:'''(Trailblazer):''' The packaging is untouched, and I don't see anyone here. It's so weird...
:'''Yancui:''' !!
:'''Yancui:''' I found out what happened. The staff from the logistic company just contacted me and said their cycranes are having some issues
:'''Yancui:''' It looks like there were no "thieves" after the takeout. I was being too suspicious
:'''Yancui:''' I'm so sorry to have bothered you, (Trailblazer). Just leave the takeaway where you found it. I don't wanna litter the streets with expired food, so I asked the logistics folks to fetch them back
:'''Yancui:''' Anyway... thank you so much for everything today
