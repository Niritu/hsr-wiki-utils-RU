:{Choice} The Alchemy Commission took her
:'''(Trailblazer):''' The Alchemy Commission's healers arrived onsite and already took Mei away
:'''Tantan:''' Do you have Mei's contact details? The speeding starskiff is already gone and I want to ask the victim for details about the starskiff responsible for this
:{Choice} Lemme try
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll try to get in touch, but don't get your hopes up.
:'''Tantan:''' Okay. I already talked with the Sky-Faring Commission. Soon there'll be further investigations for any other clues left at the scene
