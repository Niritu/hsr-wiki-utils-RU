:'''Watson:''' Seems like you've completed all the tasks assigned to you. Nice work
:{Choice} Facts!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I did all the work while you did squat. Nice work indeed!
::'''Watson:''' Hey, I helped you. If I didn't file the paperwork for you, you'd have a lot more to do
:{Choice} Now you're free?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Aren't you assigned some other work? Now you've got the time to ask how I'm doing?
::'''Watson:''' Someone's got a temper here, but don't forget, I was the one handling paperwork
:'''Watson:''' FYI, you're also the only one who took the remuneration. I didn't take any
:'''Watson:''' Finally, it was nice working with you. Much nicer than with a certain someone in the space station, at least
