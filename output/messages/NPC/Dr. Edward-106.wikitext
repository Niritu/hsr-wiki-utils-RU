:'''Dr. Edward:''' Hello, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} (Trailblazer). Someone just donated a dream bubble to our store. After conducting psychometric spectral analysis on it, I suspect you would be interested in the contents of this dream bubble.
:{Choice} Sounds suspicious...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds suspicious...
::'''Dr. Edward:''' Don't worry, all the dreams in our store have been strictly inspected and there is absolutely no possibility of hidden harm.
:{Choice} Who donated it to you?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Who donated it to you?
:{Choice} How did you know I'd be interested?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How did you know I'd be interested?
::'''Dr. Edward:''' It's the magic of psychoanalysis, {{MC|f=madam|m=sir}}!
:'''Dr. Edward:''' The donor is an elegant lady with the name "Black Swan." If you have the time, we would love to have you any time.

:'''Dr. Edward:''' Hello, {{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer)! Did I catch you at a good time? I'm developing a new collaborative project for my humble store. The psychoanalysis chart suggests that you may be interested in this.
:{Choice} Who are you?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Who are you, big eyes?
:'''Dr. Edward:''' You can call me Dr. Edward! I run the Dreamscape Sales Store on Penacony.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Dreamscape Sales Store? You can buy Dreamscapes now?
:'''Dr. Edward:''' Experiencing different Dreamscapes is as good as living out different lives! Exciting Dreamscapes can of course be sold as products.
:{Choice} How did you get my number?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Enough of this Dreamscape talk for now. I'm more interested in knowing how you got my number
:'''Dr. Edward:''' It's just some simple psychoanalysis, my dear friend.
:'''Dr. Edward:''' My store will be launching several thrilling dream bubbles. We're tentatively calling it the "Apocalyptic Shadow" series.
:'''Dr. Edward:''' The selling point of this series is to place the user in the middle of an apocalypse and have them personally feel the despair of watching on helplessly as the world collapses.
:{Choice} Who would want to feel despair?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Despair? That's the selling point? Who would want that?
:'''Dr. Edward:''' You may not know this, but being in a happy and harmonious environment for too long can numb one's spirit, and soon, nothing will be able to evoke joy anymore. This is where we come in &mdash; to offer a small stimulus of sorts.
:'''Dr. Edward:''' My secret partner hopes that you, dear {{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer), can help to give her a little push in this.
:'''Dr. Edward:''' If you can make the mass production and serialization of the Apocalyptic Shadow series a reality, you can be sure that you'll be offered generous material rewards as recompense.
:{Choice} Why me?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why is your secret partner specifically looking for my help?
::'''Dr. Edward:''' I'd love to answer you, but I'm not privy to that information. She has the right to keep trade secrets, well, a secret, and I understand and respect that.
:{Choice} Who is "her"?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Who is this secret partner of yours?
::'''Dr. Edward:''' I'd love to answer you, but I'm not privy to that information. She has the right to keep trade secrets, well, a secret, and I understand and respect that.
:{Choice} Now's not a good time.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sorry, this isn't a good time.
::'''Dr. Edward:''' No problem. We're happy to wait till you're available.
:'''Dr. Edward:''' Do meet with her to discuss the details of your collaboration when you have the time. From what I know, she should be in "a city chiseled out of the Primordial Dreamscape" now.
